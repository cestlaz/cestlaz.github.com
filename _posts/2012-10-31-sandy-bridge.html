Here's what the bridge leading across the West Side Highway over to
Stuy during the storm. Hence the title with the weak tech reference.

The storm has kept the schools closed all week so it's as good a
time as any to try to ressurect this blog.

As you can see, I've moved from blogger to a Jekyll based blog hosted
on Github. I'm really likeing the way it works but more on that at a
later date.

Some time Monday evening or Tuesday morning, I asked Batya if she
thought my seniors would be up for a livestreamed class (Batya, my
daughter, for anyone who doesn't know, is in one of the sections of
the class). It turned out they were all in. So that led to today's
experment: a Google+ hangout based live stream of Stuyvesant's
Software Development class. In my favor was the fact that I was just
going to introduce CSS - not a subject that lends itself to deep
classroom discussion. Against me was the use of technologies I haven't
used before and the fact that we have about 64 students that I was
hoping to reach.

So, how did it go?
