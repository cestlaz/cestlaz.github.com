Here's what the bridge leading across the West Side Highway over to
Stuy during the storm. Hence the title with the weak tech reference.

The storm has kept the schools closed all week so it's as good a
time as any to try to ressurect this blog.

As you can see, I've moved from blogger to a Jekyll based blog hosted
on Github. I'm really likeing the way it works but more on that at a
later date.
