My last post I was talking about the fact that as teachers, our
knowledge and experience is frequently trivialized. The tenor of the
times is that anyone can design a course, anyone can teach, and in
fact, we don't even need teachers, just videos or computer based
systems. If you've ever tutored a friend, you're more than qualified. 

<p>
That might be a strong statement but everywhere you look you see
"education" programs designed and implemented by non teachers. and
those two or three years and out people are not teachers. 

<p>
Today, I thought I'd look at a lesson I taught the other week. How
I've seen similar material presented and how my colleagues and I treat
the subject.

<p>
We use <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> in
our Sophomore level intro course. It's a highly parallel version of
logo. It's very visual, it's great for modelling and you can introduce
deep, meaningful concepts such as parralel processing in a gentle
manner.

<p>
Early on the kids have to learn how to manipulate the turtles. In
NetLogo you write a single program and it's run by all the turtles "at
once." The image above is one of their early "expirements." Have the
turtles wiggle out of the center, but when they get to an invisible
border, start spinning. They do a number of variations on this theme.
