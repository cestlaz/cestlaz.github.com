My last post I was talking about the fact that as teachers, our
knowledge and experience is frequently trivialized. The tenor of the
times is that anyone can design a course, anyone can teach, and in
fact, we don't even need teachers, just videos or computer based
systems. If you've ever tutored a friend, you're more than qualified. 

<p>
That might be a strong statement but everywhere you look you see
"education" programs designed and implemented by non teachers. and
those two or three years and out people are not teachers. 

<p>
Today, I thought I'd look at a lesson I taught the other week. How
I've seen similar material presented and how my colleagues and I treat
the subject.

<p>
We use <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> in
our Sophomore level intro course. It's a highly parallel version of
logo. It's very visual, it's great for modeling and you can introduce
deep, meaningful concepts such as parallel processing in a gentle
manner.

<p>
Early on the kids have to learn how to manipulate the turtles. In
NetLogo you write a single program and it's run by all the turtles "at
once." The image above is one of their early "experiments." Have the
turtles wiggle out of the center, but when they get to an invisible
border, start spinning. They do a number of variations on this theme.

<p> 
A solution might look like this:

<pre>
; asked in a turtle context
to gospin
  ifelse abs xcor < 8 or abs ycor < 8 
    [ wiggle ]
    [ left 5 ]
end
</pre>

<p>
Let's call level one just talking about the solution by looking at the
program as a sequence of instructions. Specifically relating the
instructions to the problem, showing how it solves it, and that's it.

<p>
This is the simplest level. A book, video, or online courseware can
approach teaching at this level. A non computer scientist teacher or a
non teacher computer scientist could do so as well. Students might
learn a pattern or two but I wouldn't hope for much inspiration or
creativity to come out of it.

<p>
Let's move to level two. 
<p>
Here we might talk about "what the turtles are doing." This is a step
in the right direction. When done right, the students start thinking
about the problem in a more general sense but they're still looking at
the problem as something that exists only in the world of
NetLogo. They develop patterns but it's still limited.

<p>
Level three is where things get interesting. On the surface, the
problem is just a nice introduction to programming turtles in
NetLogo. At a deeper level, it's an opportunity to introduce the kids
to State Machines. A new way of thinking about problems and problem
solving.

A good teacher thinks about working across these levels and looks for
opportunities to introduce deeper concepts in a gentle way. A good teacher adjusts and adapts
