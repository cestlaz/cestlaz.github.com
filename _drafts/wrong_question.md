The other day, Alfred Thompson wrote a post on [Debugging Student
Code](http://blog.acthompson.net/2013/11/debugging-student-code.html). It
got me thinking of a common occurance I've seen over the years:

Students asking the wrong question.

The wrong question?

Just what do I mean by that?

Usually during project time, but throughout the year, students will aske me a coding question. They'll ask things like:

> How do I find the shortest path between two locations, I think it's called Dijkstra's algorithm?
>
 How can I model gravity and flight accurately......?



While I love teaching these topics, usually they're not what the kids
really need. So often, a young programmer gets a thought as to what
they think the solution to a problem is, they lose sight of the real
question.
