Sitting here while JonAlf talks to our hackers about using the Flask
microframework.

Today was the second day of CSTUY's Hacking Sessions. We started out
wit a minor panic - none of the laptops could connect to the
wireless!!! After a brief scramble, we finally gave up and gave our
host a call (sorry Davin) and the problem was swiftly addressed. From
there it was off to the races.

Last week we spent most of the session with mixers and setting up the
laptops. Not today. Sam started us off with a brief survey of Python -
some of the Hackers had never seen it before.

From there we divided up the hackers - making sure to spread out the Pythonistas and they were off on a project.

It was really nice to watch things develop. At first groups were four
hackers working on four laptops. Soon, with the encouragement of our
awesome TAs, it was two groups of two talking to each other and then,
groups of four all working together.
