We just finished week 4 of CSTUY's Hacking Sessions. 

I'm really happy with how our hackers are doing - they're a great
bunch and even if they don't realize it yet, are making great progess.

Meanwhile, as an instructor and program designer I'm noticing the
differences between a once a week program and having a class every day
(note - I'm not the sole designer or instructor. I have a great team -
onAlf, Sam, and Topher are three of the best teachers I've had the
privilage of working with - this post, however, is based on my
observations).

####Once a week vs every day

This is a big adjustment. In class, we only have 40 minutes but we get
it 5 days a week. Here we have 3 hours, but only on a single
morning. This means we can spend time on a large activity but once
noon rolls around, it's over.

If a student is confused, that confusion can fester for a week and by
the time we get to the next session we might not remember to clear
things up until the problem arises again.

####They can run away

In class, I know I have my students for a full term. We can bore them
or even annoy them a bit as long as we win them back. 

Some of what we teach is boring. Other things are difficult and can be frustrating for students until we dedicate enough time for things to click. 

When you know you have the kids all term, you don't have to worry
about a bad day on your part or on the students. They'll be back
tomorrow and you can win the back. 

In a once a week voluntary program you have to be more careful.

####We can't count on work over the week

I'm hoping that once we get a little further along the hackers will
want to work on projects over the week. That said, we know that Hacking Sessions is extra curricular so when the hackers have big assignments, SAT exams and the like, we have to take a back seat. 

So, the default for a Saturday program is that it's a partial restart every week. That's tough.


####Communication is tough

This is the one that's vexed me most.

Since we're only meeting once a week, it would be really great if we
can generate some online dialog in between. So far, it's been tough.

The question is - what tool to use?

Should it be something like a mailing list where they'll get stuff in the inbox? If we do this there's a danger of things getting lost in the inbox and threads being hard to follow.

Should it be some software like an online forum that the students go to? Here the hackers have to regularly go to the site.

What about a forum with email announcements?

What do we really need? A forum type situation and the ability to post links or files. I think that's about it.

So far, we've been trying [piazza](http://www.piazza.com). For me, it
doesn't do it.
