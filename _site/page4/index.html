      So today we changed things up a bit.<br /><br />Instead of having a typical lab type periods, we tried the Pair Programming Tag Team Shootout.<br /><br />We aren't annualized so while the kids that have been with me since September have been working in pairs for a while, the other half of the class is just getting used to how we do it. I also wanted to get the kids to mix a little more.<br /><br />Hence the shootout.<br /><br />Everyone got a sheet with a bunch of problems on it:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/83400730/Shootout" style="-x-system-font: none; display: block; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-size-adjust: none; font-size: 14px; font-stretch: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 12px auto 6px auto; text-decoration: underline;" title="View Shootout on Scribd">Shootout</a><iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" data-aspect-ratio="0.772727272727273" data-auto-height="true" frameborder="0" height="600" id="doc_39108" scrolling="no" src="http://www.scribd.com/embeds/83400730/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=list&amp;access_key=key-2kfbc4856l652aq1j5ik" width="100%"></iframe><br /><br /><br />I then paired them off randomly.<br /><br />The idea is complete the first problem, find a new partner, repeat.<br /><br />By the end of the period each student worked with between five and seven partners.<br /><br />I'm having them send me their solutions and partners tonight.<br /><br />The early response was good -- it's speeding up them getting to know each other and it was a nice change of pace. We had some problems coordinating switching problems, but we'll do better next time.<br /><br />All in all a good day.<br /><br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-8898870113233862529?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>

      Piloting a new course this semester - Intro to Computer Science part 2. Between the existing Intro part 1 and this, we should be able to do a pretty thorough job in preparing our kids for the future.<br /><br />We decided that we wanted the kids to make deliverables in the form of web pages - plain old html written by hand. Part of the idea was to demystify things, part was to let the kids show off their work, part was to have something that they can generate programatically as the course progressed, and part was to give them a tool they might find valuable beyond their computer science classes.<br /><br />We also wanted to help teach the kids how to find information and how to learn things on their own. Despite the fact that our students use computers all the time, they possess a widely varying skill set. With that in mind, &nbsp;here's what we tried to do:<br /><br />After a brief introduction to what a web page is (just a text file with markup) and showing them the bare<br />minimum of markup:<br /><br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1775745.js?file=simple.html"></script><br /><br />I recommended a simple editor - gedit - while resisting all my inner urges for all things emacs, and then showed them an image of a web page:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.stuycs.org/courses/ml2/zamansky/work/hw-1/SampleHTMLWebPagePicture.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="177" src="http://www.stuycs.org/courses/ml2/zamansky/work/hw-1/SampleHTMLWebPagePicture.gif" width="320" /></a></div><br />The end goal was to make a page that had all of the elements in the above image but I also asked:<br /><br /><ul><li>How did they go about finding out how to make the page?</li><li>Where did they search?</li><li>what turned up bad results (and what were they)?</li><li>what turned up good results (and what were they)?</li></ul><div>I was very pleased with the results. Just about all the kids are now able to make a web page with the components in the image above. More importantly, this is what came out of our discussion:</div><div><br /></div><div><ul><li>Everyone used Google exclusively as a search engine.</li><li>The range of&nbsp;queries ranged from things like "html tutorial," "making a web page," and just plain "html" to maybe not so good things like "gedit web page."</li><li>No one used social search or used facebook.</li><li>They mostly all found sites such as w3schools.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>I'm hoping this is a good first step in having the students find things on their own and not be afraid to try things. I think it's an encouraging start.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-984256400226014120?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>

      CS Stress</a></h3> 
    <p> 2012-01-29 00:00:00 -0500

      I've been mostly underwater for the last couple of weeks.<br /><br />End of term issues combined with the Academy of Software Engineering announcement has pretty much eaten up all of my out of class time.<br /><br />It's going to be a week or so before I can finish writing the posts I was planning on, but it looks like a storm is brewing around Stuyvesant and Computer Science so I thought I'd put up this short semi-related post.<br /><br />Stuyvesant has a reputation of being something of a pressure cooker. The day can be as long as ten periods and it's not uncommon for a student to take three or more AP classes, even before the senior year. The question of student workload and stress has been a hot topic for a number of years.<br /><br />There's frequently tension over how many courses and which courses a student should be allowed to take. &nbsp;Usually, this revolves around the school placing a limit on the number of classes, or more specifically, the number of A.P. classes a student can take. Most recently, the conversation looks to be turning to the number of classes a student can take overall.<br /><br />Given that most A.P. classes fall within a Stuyvesant student's required sequence of classes - that is, Calculus is just "the next math class" and A.P. U.S. History is slotted in place of a students regular U.S. History course, limiting the number of classes a student can take, A.P. or otherwise could have a major impact on Computer Science at Stuyvesant.<br /><br />What's most disturbing is that limiting student options in terms of courses may not do anything to decrease stress and workload. No one has looked at what is actually going on in student's required classes.<br /><br />I decided to collect some information from our students. I sent out a survey to five of our seven A.P. C.S. classes (three of mine, two of JonAlf's -- the other two classes don't have a mailing list). I asked them to rate the work load and stress factor for A.P. CS, their typical Stuy course and their typical Stuy A.P.course. So far, I've gotten 80 responses (out of about 150 students emailed). Here's what we got (ratings were on a 1-10 scale):<br /><br /><br /><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>A.P. C.S.</th><th>Reg. Class</th><th>A.P. Class</th></tr><tr><td>Workload avgs   </td><td>4.97    </td>   <td>6.65    </td>   <td>7.13    </td>   </tr><tr><td>Workload dev   </td><td>1.94    </td>   <td>1.41   </td>   <td>1.52   </td>   </tr><tr><td>Stress avgs   </td><td>4.67   </td>   <td>6.39    </td>   <td>6.94   </td>   </tr><tr><td>Stress dev   </td><td>2.24   </td>   <td>1.63    </td>   <td>1.64    </td>   </tr></tbody></table><br />I know this isn't really hard data, but it seems that our A.P. C.S. classes are considered to be both easier and less stressful than other classes at Stuyvesant. Given that our kids do very well at C.S., we're probably doing something right and it will be a shame if student opportunities become limited. I'll certainly write more on this as the situation develops.<div><br /></div><div><div><br /></div><div>For you educators out there, is stress an issue at your schools and how do you deal with making room for students to take CS at your schools?&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-7465860293098412736?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
