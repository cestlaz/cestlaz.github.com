<p><p>
      One evening, many years ago, when I was in college, I had an epiphany. Maybe not as enlightening as the epiphany I had while watching "The Mummy Returns"&nbsp; many years later, but that's a story for another day.<br /><br />While working on some class project, I realized that soon, within a couple of&nbsp; years, I'd be working for a real company and I'd actually have to write code that <b>REALLY</b> works. Not just something that gets past the grader, or answers all the test cases. Something well designed, well written, maintainable, and reliable.&nbsp; Scary thought.<br /><br />I've thought about this a lot since I started teaching computer science. We teach programming languages, algorithms, and assign projects. Maybe the students hear something like "comment your code," or "use good variable names," but we never really give them the tools to take a project from description to completion.<br /><br />Too often young programmers rush to the keyboards and write copious amounts of code without any plan and with little discipline. In short they do everything they can to set themselves up for a difficult road ahead.<br /><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div>There are probably a number of reasons for this. When we teach introductory&nbsp; programming, assignments are so short and simple that we can't easily model good programming techniques, and if we do, it's difficult to get students to "buy in" since it's hard for them to see the value. As complexity increases, we're faced with limited time to actually cover the prescribed course content, leaving little room for a protracted unit on "program development."<br /><br />I'm certainly not going to be so bold as to say that I have the answer to the problem, but I've tried some things to help address it.<br /><br />We'll take a few class days to take a project from beginning to end. Something that can be done incrementally but isn't particularly difficult. <br /><br />This semester, I attempted this with my AP students. We wrote a series of text filters in Java. I lifted the topic from Kernighan and Plauger's "Software Tools." We wrote versions of character count, word count, detabbing a file, run length encoding and a simple version of tr. Nothing too heavy, but it allowed us to focus on the development piece rather than coming up with clever algorithms and data structures (which is what the rest of the class is for). The problem may be a little contrived, but I hope the benefits outweighed any issues with the choice of problem.<br /><br />We start by talking about the importance of understanding the problem, which includes finding out what "the client" wants and not making our own assumptions. Some times, I try to leave a little ambiguity to give us a platform to discuss the "what the client wants" issue.<br /><br />From there comes design, which might be mixed with writing some code to make sure we understand certain aspects of the problem and the environment we'll be working in.<br /><br />Once we have a design and a plan we can start incremental development. This is what I think is most important for the youngsters. I try to model and emphasize the idea of coding one "concept" at a time. Frequently testing that concept and only moving on once it's completed. <br /><br />I'll also talk about things that have worked for me along the way. I always like to put consistent comment blocks at the top of my functions, trying to keep functions a "screen length" or shorter, my preferences for naming, indentation, etc. Of course, I'm careful to emphasize that my way works for me, but it's just one approach. I try to present alternatives when possible.<br /><br />Other ideas I try to emphasize is actually reading ones code and having others read it. Last semester I experimented with "pair programming" and while I have no idea how good it is as a professional development technique, I like it from a pedagogical point of view.<br /><br />I think presenting these ideas while actually developing the project helps to drive in the concepts.<br /><br />I'd like to think adding units like this helps to develop stronger programmers. Any teachers out there -- your thoughts?<br /><br /><br /><center><br /><br /><br /><table style="width: auto;"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ljE9q55t6ltZzZVKwTzA9g?authkey=Gv1sRgCOSJ5YGwwb7e_AE&amp;feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/S3m2eJx5aiI/AAAAAAAAFj4/I57gKwaFxzQ/s144/2010-02-15%2008.49.59.jpg" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br /><br />In an unrelated note, yesterday was valentines day.

      Subversion for Homework part II and the start of the new term</a></h3>

      Starting the new semester tomorrow and I've got a whole bunch of interesting topics to blog about. Some about pedagogy, some technical, and some that I can't really catagorize.<br /><br />For now, though, just a brief follow up on using Subversion for homework collection.<br /><br />The basic model used in New York City for teacher improvement and evaluation is the official "observation." Either your supervisor or the principal sits in on one of your classes. Afterwards you meet and discuss the lesson and a report is written up. Basically, there are two possible outcomes: satisfactory or unsatisfactory.<br /><br />Untenured teachers are generally observed three times a semester. Tenured teachers, once a year.<br /><br />In all cases, this system is severely flawed. The supervisor sees a 40 minute snapshot out of context and is supposed to evaluate the teacher and make recommendations for teacher improvement. It's generally of limited value at best.<br /><br />Because of this, years ago, I started to ask my students to evaluate me. For quite some time now, I've used a custom written web app that allows students to complete long questionnaires over a period of weeks. The system allows me to know who submitted an evaluation while maintaining anonymity. <br /><br />I've found these evaluations to be incredibly valuable and I've used them to try to improve my classes and my teaching over the years.<br /><br />Having just wrapped the semester, I've gone through my students responses and the vast majority liked using subversion for homework. As I figured, some felt that it was a little confusing at first and there was a learning curve but most felt it was either as good as any other method and many said it was superior.<br /> <br />This combined with the fact that it makes me more efficient confirms that it's a win.<br /><br />It was also interesting that I had hardly any suggestions for alternative ways of collecting homework.<br /><br />Recently, I've been using Git for my personal development work and I'm planning on experimenting with it in one of my classes, so we'll see how that goes.<br /><br />Now, on to the new semester!!!!!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-3477377644002525047?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>

      Ok, not <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/subversion">subversion</a>, rather <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a>, the version control system.<br /><br />I've used subversion as a way for students to hand in their projects for years. I haven't used it with my intro classes as I think the learning curve is a little steep and the benefits few, but for A.P. and beyond (juniors and seniors) it's worked very well as a method of collection and I think it's good to get the kids in the habit of using versioning systems.<br /><br />A versioning, or revision control system let's an individual frequently save versions of their files, in our case, on a central server.&nbsp; One can easily go back to earlier versions as well as manage changes made by multiple developers. Once one's in the habit of using a revision control system, it can greatly improve&nbsp; productivity.<br /><br />For my classes, I would create a repository for a project, give the kids a little version control primer, and they would create projects in the repository.<br /><br />There are usually a few bumps in the road.<br /><br />At first the kids go kicking and screaming. They create the repository, and neglect it until the last minutes. I'd wake up on a project due date, check out the repository and seem maybe 4 out of 60 projects only to see them mystically appear as the closing time approached.<br /><br />As we move through the year and work on more projects, things get better.<br /><br />Students start to update their projects more frequently. Not as frequently as I like, partly because SVN gets really slow on our system, but it's still an improvement.&nbsp; Invariably, it saves a student or two when they accidentally delete all their files. Also, when things become&nbsp; a real mess, being able to go back a few versions is a godsend. A much better alternative than what they had to do in the past, which was restarting the entire project.<br /><br /><br /><br />What I find really interesting is how wonderful a tool svn is from my point of view as an educator.<br /><br />By looking at the log files, I can see who made changes and when. By looking at the diffs, I can look at the projects progress much as an english teacher might look at drafts. <br /><br />&nbsp;Version control for projects turns out to be a win across the board.<br /> <br />Recently, I've been using SVN for homeworks as well. Homework collection has always been difficult for me as I'm disorganized and forgetful. SVN has made things much easier. At the start of the semester, I made a homework repository for each student. They then check it out at home.<br /><br />Whenever a student does a homework, he or she just names it according to our conventions (HW1-name, HW2-name, etc.), put it in their checked out repository, add the file(s) and commits. With tortoiseSVN under windows it's trivial.<br /><br />This lets me easily see all of the homeworks for a student as well as all submissions for a specific assignment. Again it's an overall win.<br /><br />Next semester I'm going to be experimenting with GIT as a replacement for SVN.<br /><br />If you're looking for a way to collect and track assignments, I'd highly recommend using a revision control system.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-8125210248407710385?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
