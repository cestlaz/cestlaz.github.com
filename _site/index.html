      Making Varsity part 1 - Athletics</a></h3> 
    <p> 2012-11-29 00:00:00 -0500

    <a href="/2012/11/29/making-varsity-pt-1.html#disqus_thread"></a> 
<p><p>
      I've never been a huge fan of the way we do varsity sports, and I say
this as a guy that coached for a number of years. In NYC, we're
governed by the Public School Athletic League or PSAL. Practice time
and lack of facilities make teaching difficult, but my biggest problem
is the fact that most teams cut, that is, if you're not in the top
"n," you're out. So, if our basketball team has, let's say 15 kids on
it, they get exclusive use of the gym every afternoon during
basketball season and no one else can receive coaching or be part of
the team.

I coached Stuyvesant's fencing team for a bunch of years and I think I
did a pretty good job. We won our share of city titles but while most
coaches ran teams in a traditional way I never cut anyone -- we might
have over thirty people in a tiny room trying to learn how to fence.

I can be competitive and we often won but high school should be about
exposing kids to new experiences and the exclusiveness of competitive
sports seems to be contrary to this.

Thats why I love Stuy's rowing club. I've been involved in the program
for about five years now. Prior to that many of my CS students were
involved and they kept saying "Z - you've got to check out the rowing
club." During good weather, every Wednesday, we go up to <a
href="http://www.villagecommunityboathouse.org/">the village community
boathouse</a> at Pier 40 and row <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall_Rowboat">Whitehall
Gigs</a> - old school wooden boats - 4 oars and a coxswain. We've
rowed up to the Intrepid and down to the Statue of Liberty. 

It's a great activity and everyone's welcome. It's an athletic, team
building activity and very different from what our kids normally
do. It's an opportunity for our non-competitive kids to be involved in
a great athletic activity.

For our competitive kids, they can enter our races. Everyone can take
part in local races (cancelled this year due to Sandy) and we usually
send our top crew and a younger crew to events outside the city. Just
two weeks ago, Stuyvesant sent two crews up to Hull, MA to take part in
The Icebreaker Northeast Regional Youth Rowning Championships. Our
kids got to meet and compete with kids from all over the northeast.

</div>

If you're wondering about how we do with the non-cut format - both of
our boats won their respective divisions (first fours, the top
division, and second fours). A mixed crew with Stuy alumi won the
first sixes division. And yes, that's Batya in the picture - she coxed
our first fours.

It would be great if kids had more athletic opportunities like this. 

Next post -- how this relates to computer science.

      The day before Thanksgiving is always fun. For as long as I can
remember, recent graduates descend upon Stuy. For the most part, they
mull around the senior bar but we get our share up in 301. 

This year was a little quiet but I got to see more than my share of
graduates over the weekend as I attended the 2002 and 2007 class
reunions. I've only been invited to a handful of reunions and really
consider it an honor when I am.

I had a great time at both events but here are some notes for those of
you organizing reunions in the future:

<ul>
<li>Name tags!!!!!! 2002 had them, 2007, not so much.</li>
<li>Be a sport, give the teachers the open bar tickets (thanks 2007)</li>
<li>Maybe I'm just an old fart, but people are there to reconnect - lower the volume on the music - particularly if you don't have a dance floor</li>
</ul>

I've got to also give particular props to Gary He for keeping the class of 2002 crush lists for the past 10 years.

<div align="center">
<img width="50%" src="/img/crushlists.jpg"></img>
</div>

<p><p>

Between the two reunions and the alumni visits prior, I noticed a few
things. First. I was reminded that each years is like a separate
stratified layer. You might know a couple of students from the year
before or after, but that's about it. It's like groundhog day. Each
year has a similar assortment of personalities and archetypes and
exists in semi-isolation. I also noticed that while the graduates were
strongly connected to each other, not so much to the school.

These are two of the things that I've tried to address by creating <a
href="http://family.stuycs.org">family.stuycs.org</a>. I'm hoping this
group can bring Stuy grads together across the years. The feedback I
got from people at both reunions was very positive. I'm also counting
on this community to give back to help us in our efforts to enhance
computer science education at Stuy and in the city.

On the lack of connection to the school, I do think things will get
better. Stuyvesant's new principal, Jie Zhang was at the 2002
reunion. The fact that she was there was huge. I can't imagine the
previous principal coming in to attend a class reunion. After all,
he's the principal that tried to keep the alums out of Stuyvesant on
multiple occasions. There was also a point in the evening when one of
our alums was telling Principal Zhang that many graduates wanted to be
more connected to Stuy but felt alienated. She seemed shocked and
emphasized that graduates should be welcome at and feel part of the
community. 

It was a tiring weekend -- too many late nights, but a good one.

I sense good things to come.

      <h3> On going back to work today<h3>

Since school was still out due to Sandy, we ran a second online class
yesterday. At the end of the session, which I'll summarize below, I
told the class what I wanted them to accomplish today and over the
weekend. One student queried you mean no class on Friday :-(? Alas
no -- while students aren't reporting to school this morning, teachers
are.

Of course the logic as to why is far from sound. Some schools are
fine, some not, in our case, there's no subway service south of 34th
street or coming in from Brooklyn and we're located near the tip of
Manhattan. 

What are we going to do? Who knows. We don't have lessons to plan and
while Stuy has power, phones and internet are out. Professional
development? Even when planned extensively, I've found it to be mostly
useless (I always have to sit through math PD, for example, learning
how to use a graphing calculator). 

So, we're going to report in for no real purpose. Best I can figure,
the city wants teachers in so they can call it a professional
development day then they can try to change things so that students
will report during Brooklyn Queens day next semester thus restoring
one instructional day lost this week. Not a bad idea to recapture the
day but to make teachers - coming from all over the area - trudge in
for no purpose just to play politics is distasteful but unfortunately typical. 

To add to the insult, not only are us teachers still in the dark as to
what's going on, we weren't even told when to report until after
midnight yesterday. I woke up at my usual 5:00am to exercise but first
checked my email -- waiting was an email from Chancellor Dennis
Walcot. I recieved it at 12:52 this morning. This was when I was first
told that I was to report to school at 10:00am. I can't believe this
decision couldn't have been made and emailed out a few hours
earlier. In any event, I'm waiting until 10:00 to get in - I've often
found the building locked when I've shown up before official opening hours.

So now for the part of my job that I actually enjoy:  

<h3> How did yesterday's online class go?</h3>

Today's class was a wrapup of a mini project -- basically an
add-a-line story site. You can see an unfinished version that two of
the students put together [here](http://ml7.stuycs.org:5200). You can
see more of the stuff we are using on our [class github
page](http://github.com/organizations/stuycs-ml7). The students are
using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) which is a python website
generator along with [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org). We had to tie
up some loose ends.

We again broadcast a Google+ hangout live through YouTube and we again
used a google doc as a chat space. This time we used the right hand
side bar for comments and only used the document for more permanent
material (a web refernce for example). It worked much better.  The
vertical flow of comments on the sidebar were much easier to track and
work with than a freeform document.

The session still had the time delay problem and the feedback loop is
still a killer but the students again seemed to enjoy the
experience. This is clearly not a replacement for in person teaching,
but again, better than nothing on a day off.

<h3>And a note on the Stuy CS Culture</h3>

The seniors were game for this experiment and would be happy to go
again today if we were able to.  They also continually surprise me in
little ways. When we started this mini project, we all had to learn
how to use MongoDB (myself included). At first I had a hard time
confirming that they had done the outside work to learn the MongoDB
specifics. Only as they continually gave me better alternatives to my
approaches did I know that they were on top of things.

On the other hand, my sophomores were much less receptive to an online
class during the hurricane days. A handful wanted to give it a go, but
the majority never responded to my email. Why was that? 

I have a few thoughts. 

<ul>
<li>A big reason is that I've only been with my sophomores for a short
time. We haven't yet built the rapport and culture that exists in my
senior classes. I always notice a difference in class attitude around
Halloween but we really don't have the feeling of family until late
November or some time in December.</li>
<li> The sophomores are in a required course, the seniors an elective. I
think this is secondary to the culture / rapport but I'm sure it has
an effect.</li>
<li>+ I believe the seniors have a better understanding that what we're doing in class is to their benefit and the sophomores are still 
</li>
</ul>

I'm going to have to pay more attention to the time line from when
students come into my class and when they become part of "the family."
