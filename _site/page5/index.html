The mayor was announcing a new school for the fall. An Academy for Software Engineering. This has been in the works for a while and has a long way to go but the announcement was a major step. The project really got its start a couple of years ago. I'd been working hard for years prior trying to get the city to help me grow the program I developed at Stuyvesant, but until Fred got involved, there was no movement. Fred has to receive much of the credit for any good that we do as a result of this and I'd like to&nbsp;publicly&nbsp;thank him. If you don't follow Fred, you can read his post on the school&nbsp;<a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/01/the-academy-for-software-engineering.html">here</a>.<br /><div><br /></div><div>It was pretty neat to be on stage for the announcement, but those of you who know me know that I'm not a self promoter and these types of events aren't "me."</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp;What I found really special, were the emails and tweets I got from my former students over the next day or so. As a teacher, we'd like to think we are in some way a "force for good" in our student's lives and we rarely get to really see what impact we do or don't have. To hear from so many and such gracious comments brought tears to my eyes. Thanks guys.</div><div><br /></div><div>I've been thinking a lot about my career as a teacher recently. I decided to leave industry over twenty years ago. As teachers, particularly teachers with technical backgrounds we leave a financially lucrative field to enter one with very few financial rewards. It's also a field very much under attack, particularly in recent years. The current line of thought seems to be that teachers are to blame for everything bad in education and government and private interests, everything good. As a senior teacher, I'm particularly worthless, at least according to what I've heard on the radio over the past year.</div><div><br /></div><div>So, what do I get out of the deal?</div><div><br /></div><div>Well, when I hear form my graduates, I know that I've made a difference.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Also, the friendships I've developed over the years.</div><div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img class="eq" height="400" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-d1KZ2LtyNbs/TuPud4EM8hI/AAAAAAAAGq0/9M__1ubQhWI/s400/IMG_20111210_184233.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="300" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Stuy '84, '95, 2013, 2015 and families</td></tr></tbody></table><div style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><br />A few weeks ago, we were catching up with a few of the Stuy '95 crew. We do it far too infrequently. They were students, they're now friends. I've had the privilege of seeing many young people grow to adulthood, get married, have children and in a small way I've been able to share in their lives. This is the upside of my career choice.<br /><br />Maybe this is a result of being a computer science teacher who tries to keep a foot in the tech world. Maybe something else.<br /><br />From the college student who stops by just to say hello to the graduate living across the country who drops a line to say how they're doing. That's the upside of the teaching profession.<br /><br />Recently I thought it would be a good idea to organize the Stuy CS family. Collect email addresse and get a network going. I posted on facebook and sent out a few emails two days ago. So far, 240+ signups.<br /><br />A while ago someone asked me who was my favorite student?<br /><br />They're the ones that I'm still in touch with many years after they graduate.<br /><br /></div></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-1213107704301509869?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>

They end up with huge functions/methods no overall plan or design and&nbsp;everything's&nbsp;pretty much a mess<br /><br />To try to address this, and having finished &nbsp;most of the A.P. curriculum and not wanting to diverge from the other teachers, I figured we'd develop a class project before I gave the class time for their final projects.<br /><br />I'm not a huge game person, but since they decompose well, we decided on writing connect 4 - a game that can be described as tic-tac-toe but with four in a row, on a larger board, and WITH GRAVITY!!!!!!<br /><br />Actually, the choice of project didn't matter that much so long as it was the right size -- this was more about how we develop a program than about the actual program itself.<br /><br />I started by giving my classes about ten or so minutes to talk&nbsp;among&nbsp;themselves to design the program -- no guidance was given. About seven minutes in, I asked them to reflect on whatever they were discussing - if they were discussing a data structure, why? If class design, why? What was so important about whatever they were discussing that made it their first order of business.<br /><br />After a while, we started to share thoughts as a group. Most suggestions revolved around details -- how to you check for a winner, how do you make a move. This made sense - we've spent much of the term dealing with writing code fragments to do things and not too much time thinking about overall design.<br /><br />This lead to a healthy discussion of looking at things from the top down as well as bottom up.<br /><br />By the end of the class, we had identified the key classes we'd need (Board, Player, UI, Game Driver) and had some idea as to how they would relate to each other. By the next morning, we added a data structure for the board.<br /><br />Over the next few days we filled in the missing pieces. We moved up and down levels of&nbsp;abstraction&nbsp;being careful to discuss why we designed things the way we did and adapting pieces as needed.<br /><br />By the end of the project we were able to accomplish the following:<br /><ul><li>Students saw how to have classes refer to each other - that is, the Player class had an instance variable to hold the board, while the Game class had instances for Players as well as the Board).&nbsp;</li><li>We were able to use different user interfaces for the program -- starting with simple console input and then moving to a GUI -- all we had to do was extend the UI class.</li><li>Likewise, implementing a computer player (albeit a rather limited one) was trivial.</li><li>I also tried to show frequent testing and the idea of developing one concept at a time.</li><li>We discussed the idea that while design is important, there's a point where you can over design. Be aware of the scope of a project, what can generalize, and what shouldn't.</li><li>With a good design, it was also trivialize to change things like game rules, how to move, board size. etc.</li></ul><div><br /></div>Based on preliminary feedback, I think the students have a much better ideas as to how to break down, design, and build up a project from design to implementation.<br /><br />If any one's interested, the code is available&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/ml1x-z-src/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fsrc%2Fc4">here</a>.<br /><br />We'll see if it helps with the final projects, but I'm&nbsp;optimistic. &nbsp;Spending time highlighting the design and development process while building a project can only help.<br /><br />Anyone else have interesting mid-size projects they do with their classes?<br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-5982145998594622193?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>

      Stanford classes -- what I'd do next</a></h3>

    <a href="/2011/12/15/stanford-classes-what-id-do-next.html#disqus_thread"></a> 
<p><p>
      <br />Now that the ML and AI courses are at an end, here are some of the things I would do moving forward.<br /><br />Both courses already have a basic track where students just watch the lectures and do the in lecture quizzes and an advanced track where students also complete weekly assignments. I think we can be certain that there were students who just watched a few lectures, many who completed every assignment, and those who fell at all points in between.<br /><br />On top of this, there were students who made use of the on line discussion groups and those who didn't.<br /><br />This means there ware a wide range of experiences to be had.<br /><br />With this in mind, here's what I would do.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Suggestions dealing with basic site content:</span></b><br /><br /><b>More practice problems, particularly in AI</b><br /><b><br /></b><br />While there were in video quizzes each week that provided practice, it would have been nice if there was a link to additional optional problems (preferably with solutions available). &nbsp;This would be easy to implement. The ML class would also benefit from this, but since you could retake the weekly assignments and get some variation on the questions, it would be as&nbsp;necessary.<br /><br /><b>Better reference materials</b><br /><br />Reference sections would be nice as well. The AI staff posted related sections from the text, but there were a number of great on line resources I discovered by reading the discussion groups. Perhaps some of these could be linked to from the main site.<br /><br /><b>Grading</b><br /><b><br /></b><br />I'm pretty sure that having weekly assignments that were actually graded helped keep me honest. &nbsp;The fact that the ML course was submit as many times as you want and the AI course was one shot didn't matter. I put the same effort into both classes. In a way I preferred the ML course. &nbsp;I was frustrated a few times when I mis-entered something on a homework or forgot to convert units and got a lower grade than I thought I should have (I know, the grade doesn't really count).<br /><br />I'd actually kind of like the AI course to move more towards the ML class model. The grades don't really count for anything anyway, and if they did, there are so many X-factors.<br /><br />For example, if some one has to do the weekly assignment early due to obligations later in the week, he or she can't make use of clarifications. Likewise, students probably had widely varying amounts of time to dedicate towards the course. Contrast that to the traditional undergrad student probably has a similar workload to the other people in their classes. In the ML class, it all really didn't matter.<br /><br /><b>Office Hours:</b><br /><b><br /></b><br />I wasn't a huge fan of the office hour questions in the AI class but I very much liked the idea of seeing the profs directly answering weekly questions, it helped connect the instructors and the class. This was lacking in the ML class and should be added.<br /><b><br /></b><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">On running the class in the future:</span></b><br /><br />What made these classes different from other on line lectures was that these were "live" with a staff releasing new content, opening and closing assignments, and adjusting as the course progressed. Each class also had a large number of people taking the class at the same time. Far different than say someone arbitrarily to watch videos from an Open Class Ware course.<br /><br />I'd like to believe that the live staff, real deadlines, and large cohorts had a significant psychological effect. &nbsp;I've started on line courses in the past but rarely finished them. I think the weekly deadlines and "live" aspect of the course got me to start early each week and forced me to stay up to date.<br /><br />With this in mind, Stanford could just run the courses again in a similar manner, possibly with some one else acting as "instructor" to field office hours and oversee the course.<br /><br />In addition I'd allow people to take the courses in the following ways:<br /><br /><b>Solo:</b><br /><b><br /></b><br />Since many people probably didn't avail themselves of the discussion groups, there's no reason not to allow someone to start at any time. All that would be needed is the ability to have them submit projects, quizes, etc. If the system could do that, Anyone could take the course at any time, albeit without interaction with others.<br /><br /><b>Cohort:</b><br /><b><br /></b><br />People could sign up with a start date or number of students in mind. When that's reached, a cohort group can start the class. The discussion pages could be modified so that a cohort can go to it's own discussion page and the system can dole out lectures and assignments on a pre-determined schedule. This would allow the course to start at a range of times while making sure that students had a community of learners to support each other via discussion groups.<br /><br /><b>Facilitated:</b><br /><b><br /></b><br />Similar to Cohort but someone would sign up as a facilitator. They would moderate the discussion group and control the flow of lectures and assignments. There could even be a way of "licensing" facilitators so they could run official versions of the classes. This way, a local group or school could run the class on their schedule.<br /><b><br /></b><br />So, there you have it. How I'd modify Stanford's great educational experiment. Next time, I'll share my thoughts on on-line education and how it's (mis) used in our high schools.<br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-5909921438108205670?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
