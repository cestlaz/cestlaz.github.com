      Talking Shop</a></h3>

<p><p>
      <p>During my first few years teaching computer science, I frequently felt isolated. As pretty much the only CS guy I really didn't have any one to "talk shop" with. It's hard to bounce pedagogical ideas off of your colleagues when they teach subjects that are tangentially related, at best. </p><p>I now consider myself extremely fortunate that I have four terrific friends and colleagues teaching CS with me. Now we have the same advantage that other teachers have enjoyed for years.  </p><p>Today I started one of my favorite topics in my AP classes, recursion. Our students have already done recursion during the scheme unit of our intro class so today was at some levels, a review. Most of the students were fine with the basic concepts, but I wanted to make sure they had a solid foundation before we moved to more advanced problems. </p><p>I realized even though I "got" recursion back when I was starting out as a CS student those many years ago, no one ever really explained how the call stack worked. When you're calling functions and methods all over the place, how does the system know to return to the right place at the right time. It was alluded to when we expanded a recursion: </p><p>fact(4) &ndash;&gt; 4*fact(3) &ndash;&gt; 3*fact(2) &ndash;&gt; 2*fact(1) &ndash;&gt; 1*fact(0) &ndash;&gt; 1 </p><p>but never in the general sense of function calls. I thought it might make sense to try to "demystify" the computer and explain how things really worked.  </p><p>I outlined a basic memory layout, stack, heap, data segment and roughly defined a stack frame (storing parameters, local variables, and a return address). We then looked at a code snippet such as: </p>   <pre class="src src-Java"><br />a()<br />{<br />  b();<br />  c();<br />}<br /><br />b()<br />{<br />  c();<br />}<br /><br />c()<br />{<br />}<br /><br />main()<br />{<br />  a();<br />  b();<br />}<br /></pre>    <p>and traced through the stack. We then did this with a couple of simple recursive examples. Only time will tell if this was helpful, but I think it was worth the time. </p><p>What I particularly enjoyed was later that day when I was talking shop with my fellow AP teacher. He wasn't planning on explaining the stack in this kind of detail but he liked the idea and planned to use that part of my lesson. I look forward to hearing how it went. </p><p>I have likewise borrowed ideas from his and our other colleagues classes. </p><p>Any CS teachers out there, I'm sure we'd all love to hear classroom techniques that have and haven't worked. </p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-4999548631085910659?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>

      First Day Back</a></h3>

<p><p>
      <p>First day back after a break is always hard. By the last day of vacation, I'm actually sleeping a little later and shifting the body clock back is rather harsh. </p><p>It's tough enough getting started again, but it's even worse when you're thrown a curve ball. </p><p>I got in at my usual 7:00, made my coffee, and started getting my lessons ready for the day. At about 7:30 we lost power in half of the room. Unfortunately, it was the half with the CS servers. The machines that provide log in and file services as well as svn, our web server, mail server, wiki and other services. </p><p>Now, on top of my teaching duties (four classes of 32 students and another of about 20), I basically run the computer services for our CS program. I used to do the whole network, but I stopped that a few years ago. I receive some help from colleagues, but it's still mostly me. </p><p>For our CS program we have two Linux labs of about 31 computers each (all running Linux) and a bunch of servers running the same. </p><p>After spending about 20 minutes to find the circuit breaker, most services came back up. Terror struck 10 minutes later when we saw that all of the students home directories had disappeared!!!!! </p><p>After a brief period of panic and a few stressful minutes of scouring file systems for evidence of the missing directories I found the problem. The answer, as with so many other problems, is that I was being an idiot. About a month earlier, I had installed a new drive for the student directories. I had mounted it, but neglected to change the fstab file. This is what happens when you have to do all your sysadmin work on live systems in brief periods of time between classes. When we lost power today, the old drive was mounted, not the new one. It's fixed now. </p><p>It would be nice if there we actually had people to run our systems, but since that's not going to happen, I've spend time over the years to try to make the whole thing somewhat do able. Using common tools such as NFS, NIS, Apache and the like help, and we've currently moved to using kvm for virtual machines so we can easily experiment with new systems and cleanly and have a one "machine" per service mentality, but system administration still can't really be done as a part time job. </p><p>Any one out there have any war stories or suggestions as part time sysadmins? </p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-4782617949077508854?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>

      Looking for interesting questions</a></h3> 
    <p> 2010-01-03 00:00:00 -0500

    <a href="/2010/01/03/looking-for-interesting-questions.html#disqus_thread"></a> 
<p><p>
      For the winter break, I assigned <a href="http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap08_comp_sci_a_frq.pdf">this</a> set of A exam questions (actually, just the three that don't deal with the case study) to my AP classes. I wanted to assign something that wasn't particularly heavy but I didn't want my students to forget everything over break. <br/><br/>As with most AP exam questions, they're long, wordy, and somewhat brain dead. They take a long time to read, but they frequently take you step by step through what they want you to do. <br/><br/>I remember the first time I really thought about this. It was back when the exam was given in Pascal. The curriculum required that classes cover one of the nlogn sorts but didn't specify which one. One of the free response questions literally walked the students, step by step, through the merge sort. Part one had them split an array in to two parts, part two had them write a routine that merged two sorted arrays (and explained step by step how to do it). You could get a perfect score and still know nothing about the algorithm, or even about writing a recursive routine (since the question told you exactly what to do). <br/><br/>I hate these types of questions. The exam tests coders, not computer scientists. Programming competition problems (such as from the  <a href="http://www.uwp.edu/sws/usaco/">USACO</a>) are much more interesting, but from a beginners point of view they have their own problems. Beginners might not have enough tools to attack them, and at times they're all or nothing – they're not set up to develop a simple, working solution that you can then improve on. <br/><br/>So, I'm always looking for interesting questions for my students. Problems that a student can attack with a minimal skill set, but can be refined through analysis or upon studying more advanced techniques. <br/><br/>I guess the first problem of this nature that I usually do with my AP students, usually deals with counting frequencies of test student test scores, identifying students by their four digit ID number. Most students start by creating a huge list all the tests for all the students, but some, and soon all, realize that by using the ID number as an index into an array, they can solve this type of problem much more efficiently. Looking at this technique early also sets the stage for looking at topics such as radix sorting and hashing later on. <br/><br/>This weekend I stumbled upon <a href="http://20bits.com/articles/interview-questions-two-bowling-balls/">this</a> problem and we'll probably look at in in class some time this week. I like it because you can easily get a naive solution, but it lends it self to a step wise refinement that works well in the classroom.  <br/><br/>A few years ago, I also discovered a wonderful article by David Ginat, titled "Effective binary perspectives in algorithmic problem solving" which you can get if you are an ACM member <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=772942&amp;dl=">here</a>. <br/><br/>Both the stuff in Ginat's piece and the bowling ball article are nice because they can be handled naively with brute force approaches using arrays, but with a little cleverness you can do much better. <br/><br/>Of course, as students progress through our classes, we have more flexibility as to types of questions. For example, once we do search and other recursive algorithms a few weeks from now, I can present problems that lead to dynamic programming solutions.  <br/><br/>I'd love to hear any interesting accessible problems you've come across in your computing careers.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-7947206663945758208?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
