      <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">Anyone can cook</span> - Chef Gusteau</div><br />These days the rage seems anyone can code.<br /><br />On line attempts to teach coding and computing abound.<br /><br />We've got Udacity and Coursera trying to bring college level academic offerings to the masses on one extreme and more down to earth "learn to code" efforts with Codecademy getting the most press.<br /><br />While I applaud any effort to make knowledge more accessible, there are a lot of unanswered questions as to the effectiveness of these latest attempts. Recent posts by&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=13213">Dan Meyer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/04/14/udacity-cs101/">Audrey Watters</a>&nbsp;have started to raise questions and in my opinion some of the hype has worn off.<br /><br />At some point, I plan to talk at length about the Udacity and Coursera offerings as well as attempts to increase on line course offerings at the high school levels. I'll talk about the difficulties and dangers that lie ahead.<br /><br />Today, I'd like to talk about the more vocational offerings such as what Codecademy is doing.<br /><br />The premise seems to be that anyone can code and that everyone should code. I've been thinking about this for a while and I keep coming back to the question, "what's the endgame?"<br /><br />Teaching Javascript, HTML and the like narrowly focuses on creating web pages. Even if we forget about difficulties of on line learning that include lack of an interactive feedback loop, lack of follow up, &nbsp;a narrow curriculum, and the fact that programming beyond the basics is not easy, what's the goal? While I find making an interactive web site cool, I don't know how much it benefits the masses.<br /><br />One could argue that the mental exercise of programming is a benefit and having a better understanding of how a computer works is a good thing. I'd agree, but what we really could benefit from is a different paradigm in terms of how we approach using computers. A new approach would make even rudimentary scripting skills of greater value to all.<br /><br />Most of us use computers as program loaders. That is, we sit down, load our word processor, edit something, and exit the word processor. Load our web browser, search the web, exit, load the next program, do something, etc. We might have multiple programs up at the same time, but we use them in isolation.<br /><br />This is how most people's computing experience has evolved.<br /><br />With this mindset, I'm not sure how useful coding will be for the masses. People might benefit from some rudimentary scripting a la Excel macros or Google App Scripts, but power users already do this. I don't think that the ability to program within the constraints of scripting individual applications will be a game changer. &nbsp;To make rudimentary programming skills valuable we must use computers in a way that allows us to use simple techniques to tie together powerful applications.<br /><br />A few years ago, right before our Christmas break, I stopped over in the Math Chairman's office to wish him a good holiday. Danny was hard at work. He was frantically trying to change the math web site before he left.<br /><br />The math site was a mess. It consisted of a few dozen loosely arranged folders each with multiple sub folders. Danny was looking in each folder for old sample final exams, each saved as a Tiff file. He would load the file into Photoshop, convert it to another format and save it. He would then change the corresponding HTML file to reference the new file. He had been at it for hours with no end in sight. I said "Danny, I've got this, go home."<br /><br />I went to my office, wrote a small shell script, maybe 10 lines, hit enter, got on my bike and rode home. When I got there, the job was done.<br /><br />Now Danny's a really smart guy and he's technically savvy. The difference is that I was taught to try to tie programs together through the command line while he was taught to do things in the Windows/Mac way of loading one program and using it in isolation. I used a simple shell script to tie together a number of powerful Linux applications (find, imagemagick, sed) rather than pointing and clicking over and over again.<br /><br />I've seen this "program loader" mind set time and time again and in surprising places. My good friend and colleague&nbsp;<a href="http://garyrubinstein.teachforus.org/">Gary Rubenstein</a>&nbsp;has done a lot of work debunking the "educational reformers" that are currently in power. Gary had been using Excel to do all his analysis until I pointed out that he could download his data and use simple Python scripts to greater effect. Why was I&nbsp;surprised that Gary wasn't already doing this? Well, in addition to being an amazing math teacher, Gary holds a Masters degree in Computer Science and had worked as a professional programmer in a prior life.<br /><br />Of course, our life isn't made any easier with closed file formats and vendors that try to isolate their data, but if we could re-educate people to use computers across applications, that would make rudimentary programming useful to all and then indeed there would be a reason for everyone to code.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-448488222916899193?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>

I put out some feelers and the response has been great. So far we have about 400 members. I like to refer to us as the Stuy CS family since I'd like to think there's a stronger bond than that typical between a teacher and his students.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd also like to think there's a common thread across the years that ties the older and younger graduates together.<br /><br />To kick things off, I thought it would be a great idea to get the alums together with the current students. We've got people all over the tech map, from giant companies to startups. I started putting a list together&nbsp;<a href="http://family.stuycs.org/pbs">here</a>. I thought it would be great to expose our current students to the range of possibilities that await them.<br /><br />Immediately, the family came through.&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/noah_weiss">Noah</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/whizziwig">Dave</a>&nbsp;volunteered FourSquare as host for the event. They provided the food and the site. The alternative would have been to have the event at Stuy. This would have cost us and would have been somewhat mundane. Just being at a place like FourSquare seemed to really excite the current crop of Stuy students.<br /><br />The evening of the event, I was a little nervous -- about 100 alums signed up, but would they show. I've been told that general alumni events can typically have a very high no-show rate, particularly when the event has no cost and registering is as easy as an email.<br /><br />The kids and I arrived early -- school lets out at 3:30 and the event didn't start until 6:00. As 6:00 approached, the alums started to dribble in. By the time we started, we had a packed house!!! It was great seeing everybody again.<br /><br />We had alums from every year. From 1995, my first set of&nbsp;graduates, to last years senior class. We also had a few older alums, including me and &nbsp;my classmate and friend Steve from '84 and Gerry ('76) , who I met when he volunteered to help Stuy CS back in the 90's. He's become a good friend to both me and the program in the years since.<br /><br />For my part, I was extremely touched that everyone showed. As a teacher, you'd like to think you've had enough of an impact that your students would give back, but we rarely get any evidence as to the effects we've had. I've been fortunate enough to be in contact with a number of my alums through the years and a number of them have been kind enough express gratitude (often times more than I deserve) but to see everyone show up en masse really meant a lot to me. The only down side was there was so much going on, I really didn't get to spend time with anyone -- it was like hosting a wedding or bar mitzvah -- everyone's there, but you don't get to see anyone. I hope we can remedy this with more events and smaller events in the future.<br /><br />If any of the "family" is reading this, you've also got to give me some props -- even though I haven't seen many of the alums in years, I recognized almost everyone and remembered far more names than I probably deserved to.<br /><br />We spent the evening mixing students and alums and the FourSquare crew threw in tours of the facilities. Afterwards, many of the alums stayed back to discuss how to move Stuy CS forward. How the alumni community can help Stuy CS&nbsp;and it's current students and how it can become a resource for fellow alums. I think there are a lot of things we can do as a community, and I'm excited about what's to come in the near future for us as a group.<br /><br />For the students, feedback has been terrific. I've gotten comments like:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I was wavering between whether or not I would continue CS in college and as a career, but now I'm fairly certain.</span></blockquote><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); color: #222222; font-family: inherit;">and</span></div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I really enjoyed the compsci&nbsp;</span><span class="il" style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">event</span><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">, it was very helpful to talk to alumni because they reminded me that there is life after college.

      <br />When kids are knee deep in nlog(n) algorithms and working on recursion, it's easy to lose track of the amazingly neat things that are right around the corner for them.<br /><br />I've recently been working on organizing our Stuyvesant Computer Science alumni network and am putting together a page with some of the places our graduates work&nbsp;<a href="http://family.stuycs.org/pbs">here</a>.<br /><br />It can be hard to see how one goes from sorting and searching in Java to working at places like Google, or FourSqurare or creating your own startup like <a href="http://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>, <a href="http://usablehealth.com/">Usable Health</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.timehop.com/">TimeHop</a>, or <a href="http://prophop.com/">PropHop</a>.<br /><br />We try to show how close they are to doing really cool things, like the other day when we developed some solutions that lead to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/SCWeb/imret/index.html">seam carving</a>, but there's still a large enough gap between what they are learning and where they will be that it's hard for them to see how close they are.<br /><br />With this in mind, yesterday, we took a field trip.<br /><br />Being an NYU Alum myself &nbsp;(BA '89, MS '95?), the CS people at Courant and I have periodically tried to form a partnership but there were internal problems at NYU that prevented us. Over the past few years, however, things have changed and we're well on our way.<br /><br />Thanks to the efforts of the always amazing <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/~korth/">Evan Korth</a>, Michael Overton, Rosemary D'Amico, Romeo Kumar, Shawn Abbot, and others, we were able to bring about 100 Stuyvesant juniors to NYU for a day of computer science.<br /><br />We had four amazing presenters.<br /><br /><a href="http://blog.kenperlin.com/">Ken Perlin</a>&nbsp;batted leadoff talking to the kids about a variety of his interests. Basically a&nbsp;smorgasbord of places one can go to with CS. Ken touched on things ranging from expressing emotions from an animated &nbsp;avatar composed of five polygons to paradigm shifts relating to ebooks.<br /><br /><a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/~fergus/pmwiki/pmwiki.php">Rob Fergus</a> then gave a talk on image deblurring. Where Ken's talk provided a range of topics, Rob focussed in on one. The kids were really able to see how what they're doing now is just one step from solving some really neat problems.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.news.cs.nyu.edu/~jinyang/">JinYang Li</a> was next. Her talk focused on systems touching on infrastructure issues and&nbsp;parallel&nbsp;processing. This provided an overview of one specific field in computer science.<br /><br />Batting cleanup was Nathan Hull. Nathan talked about IOS developement. The most hands on topic of the day. Nathan really emphasized the fact that the kids could just download the tools to do either IOS or Android development and with online resources, they could teach it to themselves.<br /><br />All this was followed by a great lunch.<br /><br />It was a great range of talks and the kids left having a much better idea of what CS will be like in college and the range of things they'll be able to do.<br /><br />Right now, I'm working on another event which will bring our students together with Stuy graduates working in the industry to give our kids more exposure to the step after college but more on that in a few weeks.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-4837721709455320779?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
