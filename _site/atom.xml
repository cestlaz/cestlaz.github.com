   <title>Making Varsity part 1 - Athletics</title>
   <link href="http://cestlaz.github.com/2012/11/29/making-varsity-pt-1.html"/>

   <content type="html">I've never been a huge fan of the way we do varsity sports, and I say
this as a guy that coached for a number of years. In NYC, we're
governed by the Public School Athletic League or PSAL. Practice time
and lack of facilities make teaching difficult, but my biggest problem
is the fact that most teams cut, that is, if you're not in the top
&quot;n,&quot; you're out. So, if our basketball team has, let's say 15 kids on
it, they get exclusive use of the gym every afternoon during
basketball season and no one else can receive coaching or be part of
the team.

I coached Stuyvesant's fencing team for a bunch of years and I think I
did a pretty good job. We won our share of city titles but while most
coaches ran teams in a traditional way I never cut anyone -- we might
have over thirty people in a tiny room trying to learn how to fence.

I can be competitive and we often won but high school should be about
exposing kids to new experiences and the exclusiveness of competitive
sports seems to be contrary to this.

Thats why I love Stuy's rowing club. I've been involved in the program
for about five years now. Prior to that many of my CS students were
involved and they kept saying &quot;Z - you've got to check out the rowing
club.&quot; During good weather, every Wednesday, we go up to &lt;a
href=&quot;http://www.villagecommunityboathouse.org/&quot;&gt;the village community
boathouse&lt;/a&gt; at Pier 40 and row &lt;a
href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall_Rowboat&quot;&gt;Whitehall
Gigs&lt;/a&gt; - old school wooden boats - 4 oars and a coxswain. We've
rowed up to the Intrepid and down to the Statue of Liberty. 

It's a great activity and everyone's welcome. It's an athletic, team
building activity and very different from what our kids normally
do. It's an opportunity for our non-competitive kids to be involved in
a great athletic activity.

For our competitive kids, they can enter our races. Everyone can take
part in local races (cancelled this year due to Sandy) and we usually
send our top crew and a younger crew to events outside the city. Just
two weeks ago, Stuyvesant sent two crews up to Hull, MA to take part in
The Icebreaker Northeast Regional Youth Rowning Championships. Our
kids got to meet and compete with kids from all over the northeast.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;400px&quot; src=&quot;/img/icebreaker1.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

If you're wondering about how we do with the non-cut format - both of
our boats won their respective divisions (first fours, the top
division, and second fours). A mixed crew with Stuy alumi won the
first sixes division. And yes, that's Batya in the picture - she coxed
our first fours.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;400px&quot; src=&quot;/img/rowingteam.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


It would be great if kids had more athletic opportunities like this.

   <title>Alumni Day(s)</title>
   <link href="http://cestlaz.github.com/2012/11/25/alum-days.html"/>
   <updated>2012-11-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://cestlaz.github.com/2012/11/25/alum-days</id>
   <content type="html">The day before Thanksgiving is always fun. For as long as I can
remember, recent graduates descend upon Stuy. For the most part, they
mull around the senior bar but we get our share up in 301. 

This year was a little quiet but I got to see more than my share of
graduates over the weekend as I attended the 2002 and 2007 class
reunions. I've only been invited to a handful of reunions and really
consider it an honor when I am.

I had a great time at both events but here are some notes for those of
you organizing reunions in the future:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name tags!!!!!! 2002 had them, 2007, not so much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a sport, give the teachers the open bar tickets (thanks 2007)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe I'm just an old fart, but people are there to reconnect - lower the volume on the music - particularly if you don't have a dance floor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I've got to also give particular props to Gary He for keeping the class of 2002 crush lists for the past 10 years.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;50%&quot; src=&quot;/img/crushlists.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Between the two reunions and the alumni visits prior, I noticed a few
things. First. I was reminded that each years is like a separate
stratified layer. You might know a couple of students from the year
before or after, but that's about it. It's like groundhog day. Each
year has a similar assortment of personalities and archetypes and
exists in semi-isolation. I also noticed that while the graduates were
strongly connected to each other, not so much to the school.

These are two of the things that I've tried to address by creating &lt;a
href=&quot;http://family.stuycs.org&quot;&gt;family.stuycs.org&lt;/a&gt;. I'm hoping this
group can bring Stuy grads together across the years. The feedback I
got from people at both reunions was very positive. I'm also counting
on this community to give back to help us in our efforts to enhance
computer science education at Stuy and in the city.

On the lack of connection to the school, I do think things will get
better. Stuyvesant's new principal, Jie Zhang was at the 2002
reunion. The fact that she was there was huge. I can't imagine the
previous principal coming in to attend a class reunion. After all,
he's the principal that tried to keep the alums out of Stuyvesant on
multiple occasions. There was also a point in the evening when one of
our alums was telling Principal Zhang that many graduates wanted to be
more connected to Stuy but felt alienated. She seemed shocked and
emphasized that graduates should be welcome at and feel part of the
community. 

It was a tiring weekend -- too many late nights, but a good one.

I sense good things to come.

   <title>Back To Work</title>
   <link href="http://cestlaz.github.com/2012/11/02/back-to-work.html"/>
   <updated>2012-11-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://cestlaz.github.com/2012/11/02/back-to-work</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt; On going back to work today&lt;h3&gt;

Since school was still out due to Sandy, we ran a second online class
yesterday. At the end of the session, which I'll summarize below, I
told the class what I wanted them to accomplish today and over the
weekend. One student queried you mean no class on Friday :-(? Alas
no -- while students aren't reporting to school this morning, teachers
are.

Of course the logic as to why is far from sound. Some schools are
fine, some not, in our case, there's no subway service south of 34th
street or coming in from Brooklyn and we're located near the tip of
Manhattan. 

What are we going to do? Who knows. We don't have lessons to plan and
while Stuy has power, phones and internet are out. Professional
development? Even when planned extensively, I've found it to be mostly
useless (I always have to sit through math PD, for example, learning
how to use a graphing calculator). 

So, we're going to report in for no real purpose. Best I can figure,
the city wants teachers in so they can call it a professional
development day then they can try to change things so that students
will report during Brooklyn Queens day next semester thus restoring
one instructional day lost this week. Not a bad idea to recapture the
day but to make teachers - coming from all over the area - trudge in
for no purpose just to play politics is distasteful but unfortunately typical. 

To add to the insult, not only are us teachers still in the dark as to
what's going on, we weren't even told when to report until after
midnight yesterday. I woke up at my usual 5:00am to exercise but first
checked my email -- waiting was an email from Chancellor Dennis
Walcot. I recieved it at 12:52 this morning. This was when I was first
told that I was to report to school at 10:00am. I can't believe this
decision couldn't have been made and emailed out a few hours
earlier. In any event, I'm waiting until 10:00 to get in - I've often
found the building locked when I've shown up before official opening hours.

So now for the part of my job that I actually enjoy:  

&lt;h3&gt; How did yesterday's online class go?&lt;/h3&gt;

Today's class was a wrapup of a mini project -- basically an
add-a-line story site. You can see an unfinished version that two of
the students put together [here](http://ml7.stuycs.org:5200). You can
see more of the stuff we are using on our [class github
page](http://github.com/organizations/stuycs-ml7). The students are
using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) which is a python website
generator along with [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org). We had to tie
up some loose ends.

We again broadcast a Google+ hangout live through YouTube and we again
used a google doc as a chat space. This time we used the right hand
side bar for comments and only used the document for more permanent
material (a web refernce for example). It worked much better.  The
vertical flow of comments on the sidebar were much easier to track and
work with than a freeform document.

The session still had the time delay problem and the feedback loop is
still a killer but the students again seemed to enjoy the
experience. This is clearly not a replacement for in person teaching,
but again, better than nothing on a day off.

&lt;h3&gt;And a note on the Stuy CS Culture&lt;/h3&gt;

The seniors were game for this experiment and would be happy to go
again today if we were able to.  They also continually surprise me in
little ways. When we started this mini project, we all had to learn
how to use MongoDB (myself included). At first I had a hard time
confirming that they had done the outside work to learn the MongoDB
specifics. Only as they continually gave me better alternatives to my
approaches did I know that they were on top of things.

On the other hand, my sophomores were much less receptive to an online
class during the hurricane days. A handful wanted to give it a go, but
the majority never responded to my email. Why was that? 

I have a few thoughts. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A big reason is that I've only been with my sophomores for a short
time. We haven't yet built the rapport and culture that exists in my
senior classes. I always notice a difference in class attitude around
Halloween but we really don't have the feeling of family until late
November or some time in December.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The sophomores are in a required course, the seniors an elective. I
think this is secondary to the culture / rapport but I'm sure it has
an effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+ I believe the seniors have a better understanding that what we're doing in class is to their benefit and the sophomores are still 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I'm going to have to pay more attention to the time line from when
students come into my class and when they become part of &quot;the family.&quot;

   <title>Sandy Bridge and Screen Casting</title>
   <link href="http://cestlaz.github.com/2012/10/31/sandy-bridge.html"/>
   <updated>2012-10-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://cestlaz.github.com/2012/10/31/sandy-bridge</id>
   <content type="html">Here's what the bridge leading across the West Side Highway over to
Stuy during the storm. Hence the title with the weak tech reference.

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img  width=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/img/hurricane-bridge.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The storm has kept the schools closed all week so it's as good a
time as any to try to resurrect this blog.
&lt;p&gt;
As you can see, I've moved from blogger to a Jekyll based blog hosted
on Github. I'm really liking the way it works but more on that at a
later date.
&lt;p&gt;
Some time Monday evening or Tuesday morning, I asked Batya if she
thought my seniors would be up for a livestreamed class (Batya, my
daughter, for anyone who doesn't know, is in one of the sections of
the class). It turned out they were all in. 
&lt;p&gt;
I've got to say that I've got amazing classes -- the fact that they're
into the same brand of insanity as I am and even willing to go again tomorrow isawesome.
&lt;p&gt;
So, here was today's experiment:
&lt;p&gt;
A Google+ hangout based live stream of Stuyvesant's
Software Development class. In my favor was the fact that I was just
going to introduce CSS - not a subject that lends itself to deep
classroom discussion. Against me was the use of technologies I haven't
used before and the fact that we have about 64 students that I was
hoping to reach.
&lt;p&gt;
So, how did it go?
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;First, let's talk about the technical side.&lt;/h3&gt;

Here's the basic setup:

&lt;img src=&quot;/img/screenshot.png&quot;&gt;

I've got two monitors and Google would only broadcast the screenshot
from the smaller one on the right. It had Emacs and a chrome going
most of the time with an occasional shell. While teaching about CSS, I
also introduced the students
to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/magit/magit/downloads&quot;&gt;Magit&lt;/a&gt; as
well as
Emacs &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/skeeto/impatient-mode&quot;&gt;impatient&lt;/a&gt;
mode both of which are awesome. On the left hand screen I had the
actual Hangout as well as the Google shared doc.
&lt;p&gt;
It turns out that you can't make a public Hangout and also stream it
live on YouTube, you can only invite people in your circles. Since
most of my students aren't in my circles, only a few could &quot;join&quot; the
Hangout. Most watched the YouTube stream and we all connected to a
shared Google Doc for notes and questions.
&lt;p&gt;
The Google Doc turned out not to be the best idea. It got everyone
writing in the same document but people ended up writing all over the
document. If something wasn't on the screen I wouldn't see it. We're
going to try something more sequential tomorrow -- maybe disqus
comments. 
&lt;p&gt;
The other two problems were the low resolution of the screenshot
broadcast and the lag. I really had to blow up the font size. If
anyone has any ideas how to do this well, please share. The lag was
also a problem since it kept me from having anything resembling a reasonable feedback loop.
&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, my students were left with this enduring image of me:


&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;img width=50% src=&quot;/img/monocle.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;And the view from a teacher&lt;/h3&gt;

On the one hand, it was pretty cool to be at home and able to work
with my students but there were some major deficiencies:

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Can't see the audience&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Even at best, with the Hangout you can only see 10 people. I'm guessing it feels like a stage actor doing a movie. I was talking but couldn't see my audience. No nodding heads, no nodding off heads, just talking to a screen. It was a little disconcerting. Teachers adjust to their class all the time both consciously and subconsciously. You might do something overt like call on a particular student or maybe sense it's time for a joke or even little things like how or where you stand. All of this was lost.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Need a better chatroom&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I mentioned that the Google Doc wasn't a great idea. I think
something that's more vertical like a chatroom will work better. I'll
know tomorrow.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;An shared board space would be very cool&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The other missing piece is a way for the students to directly interact with what I'm presenting. A shared Emacs would be amazing.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;The delay is a killer&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This was also a problem. I found myself saying or doing something then waiting until something came through the document. This hurt the flow considerably&lt;/dd&gt;

I really found the experience enlightening. People keep talking about
recorded lectures and MOOCS and all that but if anything, today's
experience just confirms to me that there's nothing like an in class
teacher, particularly with a small group of students.

That said, I think this was a good experience and my students seem to
agree. We spent part of an otherwise unproductive day in a productive
manner and we're planning on doing it again tomorrow.

&lt;p&gt;
Since Students will be home until Monday, I'd like to go for a third
class on Friday but I'll be back at work so it looks like no class
after tomorrow until Monday.

   <title>My Favorite Year Teacher</title>
   <link href="http://cestlaz.github.com/2012/05/09/my-favorite-year-teacher.html"/>
   <updated>2012-05-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://cestlaz.github.com/2012/05/09/my-favorite-year-teacher</id>
   <content type="html">Sorry for the weak title and movie reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's teacher appreciation week -- one of our lesser celebrated weeks. I'm waiting for the annual letter we get from the chancellor. Given the level of teacher bashing over the last few years, I've recently found their emails amusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I though I'd take the time to thank a few of my most influential teachers. To paraphrase: whatever good I've been able to do, it has been because I have stood on the shoulders of giants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Alan Goff - 7th grade English - Wagner JHS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great teacher, great storyteller. &amp;nbsp;Every now and then class would be spent with Mr. Goff &amp;nbsp;telling us a story of his childhood. From his school days when he discovered how to make explosive &quot;goffolini&quot; bombs and had to deal with &amp;nbsp;the bully &quot;GodDilla&quot; to when he blew his hand off with said bombs to his time in the merchant marines. I think I learned more about bringing characters to life from listening to Mr. Goff than anywhere else. I'd like to think I'm somewhat entertaining in class and it started with Mr. Goff. Mr. Goff also shared with us the range of his interests. For me this led to a life of trying to learn something about everything. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Goff passed away a number of years ago and I never had a chance to thank him. I still regret that. A few years ago, when Batya was graduating from Wagner. I drew the short straw and had to go to the awards ceremony. I love going to Batya and Natan's concerts and other things they do, but I hate these award ceremonies. When the vast majority of the students get awards, there really isn't anything special about them - I wasn't thrilled to go. It turned out that Batya won the Alan Goff Memorial Medal for writing. I didn't even know there was one. Brought a tear to my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Herb Greenhut - 7th grade History - Wagner JHS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, what can I say about Herb. He was the first teacher to challenge me to really think. Every year he would start the semester by impersonating a famous figure. Someone his students would never have heard of but their parents would have. For us I think it was William Jennings Bryan. Another year it was Thoreau. All his paperwork was under the pseudonym and he'd play us on for days. He'd engage us in debates as if we were adults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herb was a straight shooter. We were young but he never sugar coated things. Herb got us to question things like no teacher had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on about Herb. He influenced generations. By the time I was in his class in the seventies, he was a veteran and he continued on until right before his death a couple of years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my son and daughter had the&amp;nbsp;privilege&amp;nbsp;of being in Herb's class during his final years. He had retired from the school system but still taught at our synagogue. I asked them both about Herb. Their response &quot;he makes us think.&quot; Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I could go on and on about Herb but I found this piece&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://newworld1.blogspot.com/2010/12/herbert-greenhut-rip.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that does a better job than I'd be able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Richie Rothenberg - 12th grade AP CS - Stuy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way you could describe Richie would be a mensch in the truest sense of the word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richie was my teacher at Stuyvesant. He was a great teacher, but I got more from him as a colleague years later. Richie was always on the side of right and always did the right thing. Never a self promoter and never the &quot;hip&quot; teacher, &amp;nbsp;he just went about his business of being a great teacher. If there was something he could do to help a student, he did it. Many times, the student never knew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richie passed away at 50 in 1997. &amp;nbsp;The day it happened, school basically shut down. Normally a small memorial plaque is placed up near a room in memory of a teacher. This wouldn't do for Richie. Students, teachers, and alums contributed money and Madeleine Segall-Marx, artist and Stuy parent, contributed a year of her life creating &lt;u&gt;Celebration&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;File:Danny-Jaye---Rothenberg-mem.jpg&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Danny-Jaye---Rothenberg-mem.jpg/800px-Danny-Jaye---Rothenberg-mem.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be found at Stuy on the fourth floor. Fifty boxes (7x7 + 1 double box). Each representing some aspect of Richie's life. &amp;nbsp;I still spend time gazing at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These three have left us. I never had the opportunity to tell Mr. Goff how influential he was and that's something I regret. Herb became a friend, Richie, a friend and colleague and I'm grateful that I was able to express my gratitude numerous times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Robert Dewar -- Systems I and II - Courant&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert is the one college professor on my list and I will reach out to him very shortly just to share with him the impact he's had on me. I was in Robert's class during my sophomore year. If I remember correctly, we finished the syllabus in the first couple of weeks and the rest of the class became &quot;what neat stuff will Professor Dewar teach us today.&quot; There was nothing pedagogically &quot;right&quot; about our class. Just 12 or so people around a table talking but it worked. I think I learned more about CS in those classes than most of my others combined. I think a lot came from the transmitted passion for learning neat things about a range of topics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's hard to capture what made each of these teachers special. That's the problem with the whole teacher evaluation movement. Richie was the closest to being a traditional teacher but they all had different styles and different personalities. They all helped shape me into the teacher and person I am today, so again to each of them, I say thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-7008307423207728895?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Kevin's startup is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cojourneo.com/&quot;&gt;Cojourneo&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and since it has an educational bent, he thought I might be interested in hearing about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than visiting Kevin, I thought it would be fun to have him come down after school, present Cojourneo to any students that wanted to stay late and then field questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L7-QKnsProM/T5dO_0YvmRI/AAAAAAAAG_A/YsV-hRI3-ws/s1600/IMG_20120424_154655.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L7-QKnsProM/T5dO_0YvmRI/AAAAAAAAG_A/YsV-hRI3-ws/s320/IMG_20120424_154655.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Cojourneo is an interesting product. There's been a lot of hype around on line education in the past year, but it seems to me that Cojourneo's a little different. We've got efforts like Coursera and Udacity that are trying to bring university style offerings to the masses while places like Codecademy seem to be more vocational in nature. All three efforts are &quot;class&quot; based. That is, you are taking a class over a period of time. Despite some resources to make these classes shared experiences -- specifically things like discussion groups, they mostly seem to have students watching videos or working through on line material on their own.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Cojourneo's approach is to organize around &quot;journeys&quot; which aren't necessarily academic in nature, one of the journeys they have going now is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://u125899.sendgrid.org/wf/click?upn=RFLYp28x4tn3zctFtSv9u26CpQORa-2F0ctjP5N2rt-2BPjEwScoB8-2FDiOTIH3A2decWJOBzbvP-2BL04E-2BTSUUzAnnrfeBTKDP98OMWzCupR8df4-3D_0yQd2FpqhdDJMpTKTRf0-2Bgkt9TsX0gLH-2FMd1xsBq45m-2BDWXDwm9y5rOApSyT2yeJcwKLUGkENJdoY9rRSsOVmrBLVPyJXYbty3GU3x6bt2xa-2Bn7F4b-2Brh2n-2Flt7pIOH-2Bzk3N2i42qHszSVEJ5ojVeg-3D-3D&quot;&gt;Surviving the Startup Journey&lt;/a&gt;, but Kevin mentioned that they could have things like book clubs, travel journeys or any number of other types of journeys. They're also different in that they're really trying to create a shared experience -- you take the journey with a small circle of people, not solo - I love this aspect.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;By no means am I an expert, but I like a lot of their ideas.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;A bunch of students gathered and we were off. I had no idea how the talk would go but I figured that the kids hadn't had an opportunity to speak one on one with someone in the early stages of a startup so it would probably be valuable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Kevin presented the product, talked about some difficulties and decisions along the way and generally tried to give the kids the flavor of what it was like to start a product and a company. The kids tried to reciprocate by providing feedback on the product.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Most of the questions focused on the business side rather than the technical. Kevin was asked about funding, monetization, building a user base, scaling, and any number of other ideas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;All in all, I think it was a valuable experience and look forward to bringing more alums down to talk to the current crop.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-3559652079994112054?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;Anyone can cook&lt;/span&gt; - Chef Gusteau&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These days the rage seems anyone can code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On line attempts to teach coding and computing abound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've got Udacity and Coursera trying to bring college level academic offerings to the masses on one extreme and more down to earth &quot;learn to code&quot; efforts with Codecademy getting the most press.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I applaud any effort to make knowledge more accessible, there are a lot of unanswered questions as to the effectiveness of these latest attempts. Recent posts by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=13213&quot;&gt;Dan Meyer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hackeducation.com/2012/04/14/udacity-cs101/&quot;&gt;Audrey Watters&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;have started to raise questions and in my opinion some of the hype has worn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At some point, I plan to talk at length about the Udacity and Coursera offerings as well as attempts to increase on line course offerings at the high school levels. I'll talk about the difficulties and dangers that lie ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I'd like to talk about the more vocational offerings such as what Codecademy is doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The premise seems to be that anyone can code and that everyone should code. I've been thinking about this for a while and I keep coming back to the question, &quot;what's the endgame?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teaching Javascript, HTML and the like narrowly focuses on creating web pages. Even if we forget about difficulties of on line learning that include lack of an interactive feedback loop, lack of follow up, &amp;nbsp;a narrow curriculum, and the fact that programming beyond the basics is not easy, what's the goal? While I find making an interactive web site cool, I don't know how much it benefits the masses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One could argue that the mental exercise of programming is a benefit and having a better understanding of how a computer works is a good thing. I'd agree, but what we really could benefit from is a different paradigm in terms of how we approach using computers. A new approach would make even rudimentary scripting skills of greater value to all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of us use computers as program loaders. That is, we sit down, load our word processor, edit something, and exit the word processor. Load our web browser, search the web, exit, load the next program, do something, etc. We might have multiple programs up at the same time, but we use them in isolation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how most people's computing experience has evolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this mindset, I'm not sure how useful coding will be for the masses. People might benefit from some rudimentary scripting a la Excel macros or Google App Scripts, but power users already do this. I don't think that the ability to program within the constraints of scripting individual applications will be a game changer. &amp;nbsp;To make rudimentary programming skills valuable we must use computers in a way that allows us to use simple techniques to tie together powerful applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, right before our Christmas break, I stopped over in the Math Chairman's office to wish him a good holiday. Danny was hard at work. He was frantically trying to change the math web site before he left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The math site was a mess. It consisted of a few dozen loosely arranged folders each with multiple sub folders. Danny was looking in each folder for old sample final exams, each saved as a Tiff file. He would load the file into Photoshop, convert it to another format and save it. He would then change the corresponding HTML file to reference the new file. He had been at it for hours with no end in sight. I said &quot;Danny, I've got this, go home.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to my office, wrote a small shell script, maybe 10 lines, hit enter, got on my bike and rode home. When I got there, the job was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Danny's a really smart guy and he's technically savvy. The difference is that I was taught to try to tie programs together through the command line while he was taught to do things in the Windows/Mac way of loading one program and using it in isolation. I used a simple shell script to tie together a number of powerful Linux applications (find, imagemagick, sed) rather than pointing and clicking over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've seen this &quot;program loader&quot; mind set time and time again and in surprising places. My good friend and colleague&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://garyrubinstein.teachforus.org/&quot;&gt;Gary Rubenstein&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;has done a lot of work debunking the &quot;educational reformers&quot; that are currently in power. Gary had been using Excel to do all his analysis until I pointed out that he could download his data and use simple Python scripts to greater effect. Why was I&amp;nbsp;surprised that Gary wasn't already doing this? Well, in addition to being an amazing math teacher, Gary holds a Masters degree in Computer Science and had worked as a professional programmer in a prior life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, our life isn't made any easier with closed file formats and vendors that try to isolate their data, but if we could re-educate people to use computers across applications, that would make rudimentary programming useful to all and then indeed there would be a reason for everyone to code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-448488222916899193?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The CS department, on the other hand, is great at demonstrating all the things that are going on in the modern comp sci world.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;-- Asa, one of our current CS students.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222; font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Asa's comment was in response to an event we held last Tuesday. We brought 100 current students up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://foursquare.com/&quot;&gt;FourSquare&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;along with 100 of our CS alums for a mixer. Other than the fact that we aren't a department, I'm hoping he was spot on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8sE0kCWEeMU/T3cKj8o5GrI/AAAAAAAAG2A/4Ygwoo9qnfI/s1600/P1010793.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8sE0kCWEeMU/T3cKj8o5GrI/AAAAAAAAG2A/4Ygwoo9qnfI/s320/P1010793.JPG&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Stuy CS from 1976 to the present&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months ago, I started to try to organize the graduates I've had the&amp;nbsp;privilege of teaching over the years. I put out some feelers and the response has been great. So far we have about 400 members. I like to refer to us as the Stuy CS family since I'd like to think there's a stronger bond than that typical between a teacher and his students.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'd also like to think there's a common thread across the years that ties the older and younger graduates together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To kick things off, I thought it would be a great idea to get the alums together with the current students. We've got people all over the tech map, from giant companies to startups. I started putting a list together&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://family.stuycs.org/pbs&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I thought it would be great to expose our current students to the range of possibilities that await them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately, the family came through.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/noah_weiss&quot;&gt;Noah&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/whizziwig&quot;&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;volunteered FourSquare as host for the event. They provided the food and the site. The alternative would have been to have the event at Stuy. This would have cost us and would have been somewhat mundane. Just being at a place like FourSquare seemed to really excite the current crop of Stuy students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The evening of the event, I was a little nervous -- about 100 alums signed up, but would they show. I've been told that general alumni events can typically have a very high no-show rate, particularly when the event has no cost and registering is as easy as an email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kids and I arrived early -- school lets out at 3:30 and the event didn't start until 6:00. As 6:00 approached, the alums started to dribble in. By the time we started, we had a packed house!!! It was great seeing everybody again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had alums from every year. From 1995, my first set of&amp;nbsp;graduates, to last years senior class. We also had a few older alums, including me and &amp;nbsp;my classmate and friend Steve from '84 and Gerry ('76) , who I met when he volunteered to help Stuy CS back in the 90's. He's become a good friend to both me and the program in the years since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my part, I was extremely touched that everyone showed. As a teacher, you'd like to think you've had enough of an impact that your students would give back, but we rarely get any evidence as to the effects we've had. I've been fortunate enough to be in contact with a number of my alums through the years and a number of them have been kind enough express gratitude (often times more than I deserve) but to see everyone show up en masse really meant a lot to me. The only down side was there was so much going on, I really didn't get to spend time with anyone -- it was like hosting a wedding or bar mitzvah -- everyone's there, but you don't get to see anyone. I hope we can remedy this with more events and smaller events in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any of the &quot;family&quot; is reading this, you've also got to give me some props -- even though I haven't seen many of the alums in years, I recognized almost everyone and remembered far more names than I probably deserved to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We spent the evening mixing students and alums and the FourSquare crew threw in tours of the facilities. Afterwards, many of the alums stayed back to discuss how to move Stuy CS forward. How the alumni community can help Stuy CS&amp;nbsp;and it's current students and how it can become a resource for fellow alums. I think there are a lot of things we can do as a community, and I'm excited about what's to come in the near future for us as a group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the students, feedback has been terrific. I've gotten comments like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;I was wavering between whether or not I would continue CS in college and as a career, but now I'm fairly certain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); color: #222222; font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;I really enjoyed the compsci&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;il&quot; style=&quot;background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;, it was very helpful to talk to alumni because they reminded me that there is life after college.

Just about every visitor I had mentioned how much their son or daughter got out of meeting the &quot;family&quot;. People &amp;nbsp;who were in their shoes a few short years ago and are now doing great things in the tech community.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222; font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;From what I can tell, this was a unique event, at least to Stuy, no one's ever done anything like this before in any subject area. It looks like it was a slam dunk, at least with respect to value to the students.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;Now the &quot;family&quot; just has to decide where we can go from here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-6020489050963401462?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;br /&gt;When kids are knee deep in nlog(n) algorithms and working on recursion, it's easy to lose track of the amazingly neat things that are right around the corner for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've recently been working on organizing our Stuyvesant Computer Science alumni network and am putting together a page with some of the places our graduates work&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://family.stuycs.org/pbs&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be hard to see how one goes from sorting and searching in Java to working at places like Google, or FourSqurare or creating your own startup like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalocean.com/&quot;&gt;DigitalOcean&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://usablehealth.com/&quot;&gt;Usable Health&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timehop.com/&quot;&gt;TimeHop&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://prophop.com/&quot;&gt;PropHop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We try to show how close they are to doing really cool things, like the other day when we developed some solutions that lead to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/SCWeb/imret/index.html&quot;&gt;seam carving&lt;/a&gt;, but there's still a large enough gap between what they are learning and where they will be that it's hard for them to see how close they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this in mind, yesterday, we took a field trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being an NYU Alum myself &amp;nbsp;(BA '89, MS '95?), the CS people at Courant and I have periodically tried to form a partnership but there were internal problems at NYU that prevented us. Over the past few years, however, things have changed and we're well on our way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the efforts of the always amazing &lt;a href=&quot;http://cs.nyu.edu/~korth/&quot;&gt;Evan Korth&lt;/a&gt;, Michael Overton, Rosemary D'Amico, Romeo Kumar, Shawn Abbot, and others, we were able to bring about 100 Stuyvesant juniors to NYU for a day of computer science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had four amazing presenters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.kenperlin.com/&quot;&gt;Ken Perlin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;batted leadoff talking to the kids about a variety of his interests. Basically a&amp;nbsp;smorgasbord of places one can go to with CS. Ken touched on things ranging from expressing emotions from an animated &amp;nbsp;avatar composed of five polygons to paradigm shifts relating to ebooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cs.nyu.edu/~fergus/pmwiki/pmwiki.php&quot;&gt;Rob Fergus&lt;/a&gt; then gave a talk on image deblurring. Where Ken's talk provided a range of topics, Rob focussed in on one. The kids were really able to see how what they're doing now is just one step from solving some really neat problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.news.cs.nyu.edu/~jinyang/&quot;&gt;JinYang Li&lt;/a&gt; was next. Her talk focused on systems touching on infrastructure issues and&amp;nbsp;parallel&amp;nbsp;processing. This provided an overview of one specific field in computer science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batting cleanup was Nathan Hull. Nathan talked about IOS developement. The most hands on topic of the day. Nathan really emphasized the fact that the kids could just download the tools to do either IOS or Android development and with online resources, they could teach it to themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this was followed by a great lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a great range of talks and the kids left having a much better idea of what CS will be like in college and the range of things they'll be able to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now, I'm working on another event which will bring our students together with Stuy graduates working in the industry to give our kids more exposure to the step after college but more on that in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-4837721709455320779?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Pair Programming Tag Team Shootout</title>

   <id>http://cestlaz.github.com/2012/03/01/pair-programming-tag-team-shootout</id>
   <content type="html">So today we changed things up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of having a typical lab type periods, we tried the Pair Programming Tag Team Shootout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We aren't annualized so while the kids that have been with me since September have been working in pairs for a while, the other half of the class is just getting used to how we do it. I also wanted to get the kids to mix a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence the shootout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone got a sheet with a bunch of problems on it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scribd.com/doc/83400730/Shootout&quot; style=&quot;-x-system-font: none; display: block; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-size-adjust: none; font-size: 14px; font-stretch: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 12px auto 6px auto; text-decoration: underline;&quot; title=&quot;View Shootout on Scribd&quot;&gt;Shootout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;scribd_iframe_embed&quot; data-aspect-ratio=&quot;0.772727272727273&quot; data-auto-height=&quot;true&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; id=&quot;doc_39108&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;http://www.scribd.com/embeds/83400730/content?start_page=1&amp;amp;view_mode=list&amp;amp;access_key=key-2kfbc4856l652aq1j5ik&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then paired them off randomly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea is complete the first problem, find a new partner, repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of the period each student worked with between five and seven partners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm having them send me their solutions and partners tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The early response was good -- it's speeding up them getting to know each other and it was a nice change of pace. We had some problems coordinating switching problems, but we'll do better next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a good day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-8898870113233862529?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Let me Google that for you</title>

   <updated>2012-02-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://cestlaz.github.com/2012/02/08/let-me-google-that-for-you</id>
   <content type="html">Piloting a new course this semester - Intro to Computer Science part 2. Between the existing Intro part 1 and this, we should be able to do a pretty thorough job in preparing our kids for the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We decided that we wanted the kids to make deliverables in the form of web pages - plain old html written by hand. Part of the idea was to demystify things, part was to let the kids show off their work, part was to have something that they can generate programatically as the course progressed, and part was to give them a tool they might find valuable beyond their computer science classes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also wanted to help teach the kids how to find information and how to learn things on their own. Despite the fact that our students use computers all the time, they possess a widely varying skill set. With that in mind, &amp;nbsp;here's what we tried to do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a brief introduction to what a web page is (just a text file with markup) and showing them the bare&lt;br /&gt;minimum of markup:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1775745.js?file=simple.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended a simple editor - gedit - while resisting all my inner urges for all things emacs, and then showed them an image of a web page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stuycs.org/courses/ml2/zamansky/work/hw-1/SampleHTMLWebPagePicture.gif&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;177&quot; src=&quot;http://www.stuycs.org/courses/ml2/zamansky/work/hw-1/SampleHTMLWebPagePicture.gif&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end goal was to make a page that had all of the elements in the above image but I also asked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did they go about finding out how to make the page?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where did they search?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;what turned up bad results (and what were they)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;what turned up good results (and what were they)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;I was very pleased with the results. Just about all the kids are now able to make a web page with the components in the image above. More importantly, this is what came out of our discussion:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everyone used Google exclusively as a search engine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The range of&amp;nbsp;queries ranged from things like &quot;html tutorial,&quot; &quot;making a web page,&quot; and just plain &quot;html&quot; to maybe not so good things like &quot;gedit web page.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No one used social search or used facebook.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They mostly all found sites such as w3schools.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm hoping this is a good first step in having the students find things on their own and not be afraid to try things. I think it's an encouraging start.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-984256400226014120?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>CS Stress</title>
   <link href="http://cestlaz.github.com/2012/01/29/cs-stress.html"/>
   <updated>2012-01-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://cestlaz.github.com/2012/01/29/cs-stress</id>
   <content type="html">I've been mostly underwater for the last couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End of term issues combined with the Academy of Software Engineering announcement has pretty much eaten up all of my out of class time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's going to be a week or so before I can finish writing the posts I was planning on, but it looks like a storm is brewing around Stuyvesant and Computer Science so I thought I'd put up this short semi-related post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stuyvesant has a reputation of being something of a pressure cooker. The day can be as long as ten periods and it's not uncommon for a student to take three or more AP classes, even before the senior year. The question of student workload and stress has been a hot topic for a number of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's frequently tension over how many courses and which courses a student should be allowed to take. &amp;nbsp;Usually, this revolves around the school placing a limit on the number of classes, or more specifically, the number of A.P. classes a student can take. Most recently, the conversation looks to be turning to the number of classes a student can take overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that most A.P. classes fall within a Stuyvesant student's required sequence of classes - that is, Calculus is just &quot;the next math class&quot; and A.P. U.S. History is slotted in place of a students regular U.S. History course, limiting the number of classes a student can take, A.P. or otherwise could have a major impact on Computer Science at Stuyvesant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's most disturbing is that limiting student options in terms of courses may not do anything to decrease stress and workload. No one has looked at what is actually going on in student's required classes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to collect some information from our students. I sent out a survey to five of our seven A.P. C.S. classes (three of mine, two of JonAlf's -- the other two classes don't have a mailing list). I asked them to rate the work load and stress factor for A.P. CS, their typical Stuy course and their typical Stuy A.P.course. So far, I've gotten 80 responses (out of about 150 students emailed). Here's what we got (ratings were on a 1-10 scale):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;A.P. C.S.&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Reg. Class&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;A.P. Class&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Workload avgs   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.97    &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;td&gt;6.65    &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;td&gt;7.13    &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Workload dev   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.94    &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;td&gt;1.41   &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;td&gt;1.52   &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Stress avgs   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.67   &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;td&gt;6.39    &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;td&gt;6.94   &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Stress dev   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2.24   &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;td&gt;1.63    &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;td&gt;1.64    &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this isn't really hard data, but it seems that our A.P. C.S. classes are considered to be both easier and less stressful than other classes at Stuyvesant. Given that our kids do very well at C.S., we're probably doing something right and it will be a shame if student opportunities become limited. I'll certainly write more on this as the situation develops.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For you educators out there, is stress an issue at your schools and how do you deal with making room for students to take CS at your schools?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-7465860293098412736?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The mayor was announcing a new school for the fall. An Academy for Software Engineering. This has been in the works for a while and has a long way to go but the announcement was a major step. The project really got its start a couple of years ago. I'd been working hard for years prior trying to get the city to help me grow the program I developed at Stuyvesant, but until Fred got involved, there was no movement. Fred has to receive much of the credit for any good that we do as a result of this and I'd like to&amp;nbsp;publicly&amp;nbsp;thank him. If you don't follow Fred, you can read his post on the school&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/01/the-academy-for-software-engineering.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It was pretty neat to be on stage for the announcement, but those of you who know me know that I'm not a self promoter and these types of events aren't &quot;me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;What I found really special, were the emails and tweets I got from my former students over the next day or so. As a teacher, we'd like to think we are in some way a &quot;force for good&quot; in our student's lives and we rarely get to really see what impact we do or don't have. To hear from so many and such gracious comments brought tears to my eyes. Thanks guys.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I've been thinking a lot about my career as a teacher recently. I decided to leave industry over twenty years ago. As teachers, particularly teachers with technical backgrounds we leave a financially lucrative field to enter one with very few financial rewards. It's also a field very much under attack, particularly in recent years. The current line of thought seems to be that teachers are to blame for everything bad in education and government and private interests, everything good. As a senior teacher, I'm particularly worthless, at least according to what I've heard on the radio over the past year.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, what do I get out of the deal?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well, when I hear form my graduates, I know that I've made a difference.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also, the friendships I've developed over the years.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;eq&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-d1KZ2LtyNbs/TuPud4EM8hI/AAAAAAAAGq0/9M__1ubQhWI/s400/IMG_20111210_184233.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Stuy '84, '95, 2013, 2015 and families&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago, we were catching up with a few of the Stuy '95 crew. We do it far too infrequently. They were students, they're now friends. I've had the privilege of seeing many young people grow to adulthood, get married, have children and in a small way I've been able to share in their lives. This is the upside of my career choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this is a result of being a computer science teacher who tries to keep a foot in the tech world. Maybe something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the college student who stops by just to say hello to the graduate living across the country who drops a line to say how they're doing. That's the upside of the teaching profession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I thought it would be a good idea to organize the Stuy CS family. Collect email addresse and get a network going. I posted on facebook and sent out a few emails two days ago. So far, 240+ signups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A while ago someone asked me who was my favorite student?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're the ones that I'm still in touch with many years after they graduate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-1213107704301509869?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They end up with huge functions/methods no overall plan or design and&amp;nbsp;everything's&amp;nbsp;pretty much a mess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To try to address this, and having finished &amp;nbsp;most of the A.P. curriculum and not wanting to diverge from the other teachers, I figured we'd develop a class project before I gave the class time for their final projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not a huge game person, but since they decompose well, we decided on writing connect 4 - a game that can be described as tic-tac-toe but with four in a row, on a larger board, and WITH GRAVITY!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, the choice of project didn't matter that much so long as it was the right size -- this was more about how we develop a program than about the actual program itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started by giving my classes about ten or so minutes to talk&amp;nbsp;among&amp;nbsp;themselves to design the program -- no guidance was given. About seven minutes in, I asked them to reflect on whatever they were discussing - if they were discussing a data structure, why? If class design, why? What was so important about whatever they were discussing that made it their first order of business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a while, we started to share thoughts as a group. Most suggestions revolved around details -- how to you check for a winner, how do you make a move. This made sense - we've spent much of the term dealing with writing code fragments to do things and not too much time thinking about overall design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lead to a healthy discussion of looking at things from the top down as well as bottom up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of the class, we had identified the key classes we'd need (Board, Player, UI, Game Driver) and had some idea as to how they would relate to each other. By the next morning, we added a data structure for the board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the next few days we filled in the missing pieces. We moved up and down levels of&amp;nbsp;abstraction&amp;nbsp;being careful to discuss why we designed things the way we did and adapting pieces as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of the project we were able to accomplish the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students saw how to have classes refer to each other - that is, the Player class had an instance variable to hold the board, while the Game class had instances for Players as well as the Board).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We were able to use different user interfaces for the program -- starting with simple console input and then moving to a GUI -- all we had to do was extend the UI class.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Likewise, implementing a computer player (albeit a rather limited one) was trivial.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I also tried to show frequent testing and the idea of developing one concept at a time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We discussed the idea that while design is important, there's a point where you can over design. Be aware of the scope of a project, what can generalize, and what shouldn't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With a good design, it was also trivialize to change things like game rules, how to move, board size. etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Based on preliminary feedback, I think the students have a much better ideas as to how to break down, design, and build up a project from design to implementation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any one's interested, the code is available&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/ml1x-z-src/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fsrc%2Fc4&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll see if it helps with the final projects, but I'm&amp;nbsp;optimistic. &amp;nbsp;Spending time highlighting the design and development process while building a project can only help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone else have interesting mid-size projects they do with their classes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-5982145998594622193?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Stanford classes -- what I'd do next</title>
   <link href="http://cestlaz.github.com/2011/12/15/stanford-classes-what-id-do-next.html"/>
   <updated>2011-12-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://cestlaz.github.com/2011/12/15/stanford-classes-what-id-do-next</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;br /&gt;Now that the ML and AI courses are at an end, here are some of the things I would do moving forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both courses already have a basic track where students just watch the lectures and do the in lecture quizzes and an advanced track where students also complete weekly assignments. I think we can be certain that there were students who just watched a few lectures, many who completed every assignment, and those who fell at all points in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of this, there were students who made use of the on line discussion groups and those who didn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means there ware a wide range of experiences to be had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this in mind, here's what I would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Suggestions dealing with basic site content:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;More practice problems, particularly in AI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there were in video quizzes each week that provided practice, it would have been nice if there was a link to additional optional problems (preferably with solutions available). &amp;nbsp;This would be easy to implement. The ML class would also benefit from this, but since you could retake the weekly assignments and get some variation on the questions, it would be as&amp;nbsp;necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Better reference materials&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reference sections would be nice as well. The AI staff posted related sections from the text, but there were a number of great on line resources I discovered by reading the discussion groups. Perhaps some of these could be linked to from the main site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm pretty sure that having weekly assignments that were actually graded helped keep me honest. &amp;nbsp;The fact that the ML course was submit as many times as you want and the AI course was one shot didn't matter. I put the same effort into both classes. In a way I preferred the ML course. &amp;nbsp;I was frustrated a few times when I mis-entered something on a homework or forgot to convert units and got a lower grade than I thought I should have (I know, the grade doesn't really count).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd actually kind of like the AI course to move more towards the ML class model. The grades don't really count for anything anyway, and if they did, there are so many X-factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, if some one has to do the weekly assignment early due to obligations later in the week, he or she can't make use of clarifications. Likewise, students probably had widely varying amounts of time to dedicate towards the course. Contrast that to the traditional undergrad student probably has a similar workload to the other people in their classes. In the ML class, it all really didn't matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Office Hours:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn't a huge fan of the office hour questions in the AI class but I very much liked the idea of seeing the profs directly answering weekly questions, it helped connect the instructors and the class. This was lacking in the ML class and should be added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;On running the class in the future:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What made these classes different from other on line lectures was that these were &quot;live&quot; with a staff releasing new content, opening and closing assignments, and adjusting as the course progressed. Each class also had a large number of people taking the class at the same time. Far different than say someone arbitrarily to watch videos from an Open Class Ware course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd like to believe that the live staff, real deadlines, and large cohorts had a significant psychological effect. &amp;nbsp;I've started on line courses in the past but rarely finished them. I think the weekly deadlines and &quot;live&quot; aspect of the course got me to start early each week and forced me to stay up to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this in mind, Stanford could just run the courses again in a similar manner, possibly with some one else acting as &quot;instructor&quot; to field office hours and oversee the course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition I'd allow people to take the courses in the following ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Solo:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since many people probably didn't avail themselves of the discussion groups, there's no reason not to allow someone to start at any time. All that would be needed is the ability to have them submit projects, quizes, etc. If the system could do that, Anyone could take the course at any time, albeit without interaction with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cohort:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People could sign up with a start date or number of students in mind. When that's reached, a cohort group can start the class. The discussion pages could be modified so that a cohort can go to it's own discussion page and the system can dole out lectures and assignments on a pre-determined schedule. This would allow the course to start at a range of times while making sure that students had a community of learners to support each other via discussion groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Facilitated:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar to Cohort but someone would sign up as a facilitator. They would moderate the discussion group and control the flow of lectures and assignments. There could even be a way of &quot;licensing&quot; facilitators so they could run official versions of the classes. This way, a local group or school could run the class on their schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there you have it. How I'd modify Stanford's great educational experiment. Next time, I'll share my thoughts on on-line education and how it's (mis) used in our high schools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-5909921438108205670?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>ML and AI Courses - how they were taught</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;br /&gt;This is the first in a three part series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 1 talks about my take on how the courses were presented.&lt;br /&gt;in Part 2, I'll discuss my take on how to improve the experience&lt;br /&gt;and finally, in part 3, we'll look at on line education with an emphasis on the high school market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;rg_hi&quot; data-height=&quot;249&quot; data-width=&quot;202&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; id=&quot;rg_hi&quot; src=&quot;https://encrypted-tbn2.google.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSz2UVcJKxi-GaRmx3YkMgXFsbHLv3GzzHScWL3s5-C_ZxFcspk&quot; style=&quot;height: 249px; width: 202px;&quot; width=&quot;162&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;rg_hi&quot; data-height=&quot;215&quot; data-width=&quot;234&quot; height=&quot;215&quot; id=&quot;rg_hi&quot; src=&quot;https://encrypted-tbn3.google.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRgdP0dnwf27O3eF0sDEgxIswi2ahjhzwD-TOO1OoaKClry5krvPA&quot; style=&quot;height: 215px; width: 234px;&quot; width=&quot;234&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some of you know, I've been taking the on line &lt;a href=&quot;http://ml-class.com/&quot;&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=&quot;http://ai-class.com/&quot;&gt; Artificial Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; courses offered by Stanford this semester. I took my AI&amp;nbsp;class a hundred years ago and I never formally studied ML so I figured this would be a fun way to keep current.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of people have already &quot;reviewed&quot; the courses, compared the instructors, assignments, and what have you. Now that the courses are almost over, I thought I'd try to look at it a little differently, wearing my hat as a high school CS educator rather than just a consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've enjoyed both courses tremendously and I'd like to thank everyone involved in making them available to the public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;Teaching style:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every teacher has their own style. &amp;nbsp;Here's my take on our three instructors. I don't think any one style is universally better than any other, rather different styles speak to different students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Peter Norvig:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While watching Professor Norvig's videos, I felt that he was the learned sage imparting information. He's the wise man in the village that everyone turns to for answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Andrew Ng:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt like I was with a tutor or a coach, everything was gently presented and at the end of the lecture I looked back and said &quot;wow, I got all of that, it made sense.&quot; As he was the only lecturer for the ML class, I'll explain in more detail in the next section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Sebastian Thrun:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't come up with an analogy for Profressor Thrun, but I could feel him saying &quot;let's try something neat, make some mistakes, explore neat things, and learn a whole bunch as a result.&quot; It took a while to get used to this, particularly when being asked questions before given enough information to approach them. Once used to the technique, however, I really enjoyed his approach to teaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;I would love to have the opportunity to sit in on live classes with all three as sitting in on a class can be very different from watching a video, but being on the east coast, I don't think that will happen any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;Lecture style:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the ML lectures, Prof. Ng gently guided the viewer through the topics. Generally first by describing the various parts of the topic in question and then by bringing it all together, completely describing the algorithm or technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are points in the lectures where Prof Ng states that the material is hard and that he had a tough time with some of it. This empathy and his assurances go a long way. I found the lectures easy to absorb and didn't generally have to think too hard. By itself this might have limited the educational experience, but combined with the assignments, it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AI class had a different approach. The class was frequently tasked with solving problems before material was presented. This turned me off early on. As the class progressed, the professors started to emphasize the fact that your quiz scores didn't matter (they appear on the web site but aren't calculated in the final grade, not that the final grade matters anyway) and that these questions were to get you thinking about the topic more deeply. Once I started looking at the approach from this point of view, I enjoyed the class much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I found the ML class lectures much more self contained and found myself looking for additional resources to learn the &quot;base&quot; material at times in the AI class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AI lectures forced &amp;nbsp;me to think more than the ML class which is probably a good thing since there were no programming projects to take up the slack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/b&gt;Styles differ but both can be effective. I could make as much or as little a mental effort as I wanted for the ML class and I'd get out of it what I put in. The AI required more effort to get anything out of it -- the approach forced you to think where the ML class encouraged you to think. In the end, I put comparable amounts of time into both and got about the same amount out of each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;Homework and Projects:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both classes had weekly homework assignments. Without these, I would probably have slacked off on the videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the AI class, these were submitted over the course of the week and then graded. Results and explanation videos were provided after grading was done. The process was fine but I found the interface occasionally frustrating. There were some complaints on the message boards about losing points due to mis-entry or insufficient accuracy of answers. I &amp;nbsp;had a few problems with both but since I wasn't obsessed with getting a perfect score, it didn't bother me too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not sure how great the assignments were in terms of assessments but attempting them and then watching the video explanations turned out to be a strong pedagogical approach. I would recommend including the explanation videos in the regular sequence for the in lecture quizzes. I frequently gleaned a tidbit or two from them even when I answered the questions correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to the AI class quizzes and homeworks is that they were all in video form. A PDF of the midterm was published and something similar, at least for the weekly homework assignments would be a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ML class also had weekly assignments. They were in the form of an interactive five question quiz. You could attempt them up to 100 times and your top score would count towards your grade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real value added to these assignments was the explanations when you answered one wrong. There were even a couple of times I answered a question or two incorrectly on purpose to see the explanations provided. &amp;nbsp;This style of assessment provided a feedback loop that could really help a student to be sure they understood the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing the AI class lacked that the ML class included was programming assignments. Probably a good thing for me since I don't think I would have had the time to be able to complete both courses with that added burden. That said, I loved the ML class programming assignments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, they were extremely well constructed, stepping the student through all of the weeks topics. By the end of each project, we had a working system and a good understanding of the weeks concepts. You could take shortcuts and finish the assignments by merely copying and coding up formulas but if you did it right, you'd learn a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only assignment that I felt was less than stellar was the SVM project. Even then, it had redeeming features. For part of the project we had to process emails and build a table of word counts. Not directly related to SVMs but something that's frequently done with data to be processed and therefore still worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/b&gt;The programming projects really reinforced the lecture content in the ML class and I would imagine that adding them to the AI class would benefit students. Even without them, one could go to the actual Stanford class'es web site and work on their projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other random thoughts:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-size: x-large;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both courses used the web site, email, and twitter to periodically communicate information, but the AI did one thing the ML class didn't. They periodically sent messages of congratulations and encouragement. They also repeatedly mentioned how well we were all doing in the lectures and in the office hours. Prof. Ng also provided encouraging words, but they seemed more self contained and generic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I wasn't happy with the large numbers of hints and deadline extensions that the AI class offered. I felt that it rewarded people who left things to for the last minute and gave them an advantage over students who were more diligent or had to complete the weeks work early and could not take advantage of the last minute hints and extensions. Ultimately it doesn't matter, but that's the type of thing that pushes my buttons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/b&gt;Again, both courses were great, but the AI course seemed to do a better job in connecting with the class, that is, making me feel like I'm part of the class rather than just watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, that was long. I hope some one finds this interesting. In the next installment, I'll talk about what I would do if I were moving these projects ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-3798273183924664881?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Over the years, I've tried different things when teaching 2 dimensional arrays. Simple game boards, representing a crossword puzzle, tables of various sorts, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jonalf.com/&quot;&gt;JonAlf&lt;/a&gt;, one of my amazingly talented colleagues,&amp;nbsp;decided to go with building a word search. I decided to steal the idea. It's a great one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I'd use this post to go through the project and why I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, the students end up with a program that will generate an n by m&amp;nbsp;word search filled with random words from a dictionary. We gave the kids a skeleton of the base class. The only actual code we had to supply was the method that loaded a dictionary file into memory. You can check out the assignment &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/a/stuycs.org/home/courses/ml1x/zamansky/work/hw-20-duetbd&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;the finished code&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/ml1x-z-src/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fsrc%2FWordSearch&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(we updated the repository as the project developed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first part of the project are pretty mundane. The kids write a couple of constructors and toString. Basically just practice traversing a 2D array. The project starts to get interesting at part 2, when they write the methods that add words into the grid. First horizontally:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1428475.js?file=addWordH&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After they write the method to add words vertically, we can start to refine things. We notice that the routines are essentially the same. The only difference between adding a word horizontally and vertically is &amp;nbsp;what we add &amp;nbsp;to the row and column each time. For one, there is a delta column of + 1, for the other it's a delta row. Further, they realize that adding diagonal words just needs both deltas. This leads us to factoring out the common aspects of the code and writing something like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1428495.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of a sudden, they've written one piece of code that can add words in 8 orientations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After filling the rest of the grid with random letters, we turn our attention to building a random puzzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This part of the project involves using an ArrayList of words. Our students frequently mix up array and ArrayList notation early on so by having a project that uses both but in clearly delineated areas, the students can be more comfortable with each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this piece, the code is again straight forward. Students run a loop that gets a random word from our dictionary and tries to place it in our grid at a random location choosing one of our possible orientations randomly. We get to see another nice little refinement again when we move from the typical first take at building a random puzzle which uses a three (or more) way if statement to select how to add words:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1428594.js?file=addWords1&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to using our more general addWords method described above:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1428599.js?file=addWords2&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we're all done, we had some time to project the word search on the board and fun was had by all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter, another one of our CS teachers had a great suggestion that I think I'll try. Start a competition to have the students modify the program so that it generates as densely packed &amp;nbsp;a wordsearch &amp;nbsp;as possible (giving higher scores first for longer words, then number of words).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the way the project broke down, the topics covered and the little refinements, I really enjoyed working with my classes on this project -- I'm hoping they enjoyed it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-2041316883816388484?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Reboot</title>

   <id>http://cestlaz.github.com/2011/11/27/reboot</id>
   <content type="html">A couple of weeks ago, I attended the K-12 workshop at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference. It was great to reconnect with some old friends, make some new ones, and talk shop for the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One result was that I promised to start blogging again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've got a number of ideas for posts lined up. Some on pedagogy, some technical, and some cultural. Hope you enjoy them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier today Ben Chun tweeted about this post:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://worrydream.com/SomeThoughtsOnTeaching/&quot;&gt;http://worrydream.com/SomeThoughtsOnTeaching/&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;To summarize -- teachers should practice what they preach. In the post, Bret Victor wonders if there are calculus teachers who spend their evenings doing calculus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a number of math teachers who spend a considerable amount of their free time working on problems and refining their math skills, I also know many who don't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know wonderful, inspirational teachers in both camps. I've also known weak teachers that fall into both categories. Great teachers in both categories also spend large amounts of time working on how to best deliver instruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I started developing the computer science program at Stuyvesant, there were one or two sections of A.P. Computer Science. They were taught by a terrific teacher -- one of my mentors and role models, but he was a math guy and not passionate about CS. When I took over, the enrollment&amp;nbsp;immediately&amp;nbsp;shot up. Not because I was any great shakes, and Dave, the previous teacher was legendary. Rather, the students knew I loved CS. Part of that love was that I enjoy solving problems with computers, coding and what have you. The students can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that I code is a byproduct of my passion and part of the whole package that defines me as a teacher and a person. Whatever success I achieve is a result of this package. It's something I enjoy, and it also keeps me current with the field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've seen &quot;naturals&quot; who are just great teachers and get by without a passion for their subjects. More often than not, there's a ceiling in terms of what they can give their students either in terms of content, or more importantly, in terms of&amp;nbsp;inspiration. Some times the ceiling is high enough that there isn't a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, my &quot;practice&quot; has taken different shapes. Early on, while my students were working on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usaco.org/&quot;&gt;USACO&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;problems. I figured I had better be able to represent, so I started doing them. Later on, I would write systems to support my teaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More recently, I've been lucky enough to be surrounded by a number of like minded educators. We frequently share little projects we work on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This semester, I've been taking the Stanford on line&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ai-class.org/&quot;&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ml-class.org/&quot;&gt;ML&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;classes -- both have been lots of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just what I do and who I am and it is reflected in how I teach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, time and job constraints make coding difficult during the school year. With ~150 students, lesson planning, grading, and ancillary responsibilities take their tolls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I guess I'm an example of what Bret Victor was talking about. I'm not sure I fully agree with his thesis, but it seems to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-1460836429704454417?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>The Rest of the Trip</title>

   <id>http://cestlaz.github.com/2010/08/15/rest-of-trip</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now for the rest of the trip.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rome to &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Little&lt;/span&gt; Falls&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had some trouble getting out of Rome. As always, once we're on trail, it's pretty easy to follow, but entering and leaving towns and cities, with the exceptions of canal side towns like Lockport, can be a challenge. During the day, we found that we could either follow the official Erie Canal Trail signs or the pink trail blazes painted on the streets for the Erie Canal Tour (that preceded us by a week). As we get to towns, the blazes are of little use since they lead to rest stops and camp sites rather than through. We also had the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ptny.org/guidebook/index.shtml&quot;&gt;Cycling the Erie Canal&lt;/a&gt; book. It's terrific and I recommend it to anyone riding the canal. It does, however, have one problem. When the path is on the road, it doesn't actually name the road (rather, it superimposes the path line). This made getting out of Rome a chore. Fortunately, we only added one mile to our day before we found our way out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving town we saw Rome's beautifully restored train station:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGSElnvuA5I/AAAAAAAAGBo/8xS2pUIxkuY/s1600/IMG_20100812_085625.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGSElnvuA5I/AAAAAAAAGBo/8xS2pUIxkuY/s200/IMG_20100812_085625.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGSEmflCK-I/AAAAAAAAGBw/_196cSQpiFo/s1600/IMG_20100812_085634.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGSEmflCK-I/AAAAAAAAGBw/_196cSQpiFo/s200/IMG_20100812_085634.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Also, the Fort Herkimer Church:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGSE8s3YozI/AAAAAAAAGCA/04I7vpST8K8/s1600/IMG_20100812_145416.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGSE8s3YozI/AAAAAAAAGCA/04I7vpST8K8/s320/IMG_20100812_145416.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the ride was relatively uneventful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We spent the night in Little Falls. Stayed in the &quot;Canal Side Inn,&quot; a small in with three rooms. Our's was both huge and gorgeous.&amp;nbsp; It has a connected restaurant. Fine French/American fare. Everything on the menu looked delicious, but after a day of riding, it was a little much. They also had a less expensive, less elaborate grill menu with items like Steak Frites, or scrod in an almond crust served in the lounge. As the lounge was booked, they offered us the grill menu in the main dining room. Food was excellent, including the deserts -- chocolat pot de creme, a meringue filled with strawberries and ice cream, and a blueberry bread pudding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever get to Little Falls, eat at the Canal Side Inn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it was time to turn in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miles today: 44.5&lt;br /&gt;Miles total: 313.5&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; Little Falls to Amsterdam:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Little Falls was right next to the canal, leaving town was easy. Just outside of town, we passed the high point of the canal. At the point, a lock with what I think was the canal's largest altitude change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looked to be another uneventful day. More beautiful views that have become de rigueur and more crushed stone path that was more like biking through sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looked like our two most promising lunch spots were at around 15 miles (too early) and 30 miles (too late). At 15 miles, at Canajoharie, we stopped for ice cream:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGWnOr5elOI/AAAAAAAAGDc/hvji45k5tSk/s1600/IMG_20100813_112629.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGWnOr5elOI/AAAAAAAAGDc/hvji45k5tSk/s200/IMG_20100813_112629.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first time all trip we were able to find mid-day ice cream!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Canajoharie is another one of those small towns we passed through, but they set up a little information stand right where the trail crosses main street. The young man working there directed us to the ice cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things that surprised me throughout was the lack of signage at the towns, particularly the small ones. While the traffic on the trail isn't great, a couple of signs pointing to food and refreshments at the trail heads would cost next to nothing and maybe draw a few more people into the towns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshed and refueled, we continued on. After lunch at Fultonville, we soldiered on. A few miles out of Amsterdam, we got to the Schoharie crossing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGWnDTW-NHI/AAAAAAAAGDY/LKb2Ys2kcA0/s1600/IMG_20100813_141549.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGWnDTW-NHI/AAAAAAAAGDY/LKb2Ys2kcA0/s200/IMG_20100813_141549.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, you can see the remains Schoharie aqueduct from the barge canal in the distance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGWmbWf4cZI/AAAAAAAAGDA/QDWBCAZeh_k/IMG_20100813_143044.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGWmbWf4cZI/AAAAAAAAGDA/QDWBCAZeh_k/IMG_20100813_143044.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Schoharie crossing is the one location where there are remnants from all renditions of the canal and one can also see the I90, where the bridge collapsed some 20 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also turns out that this was the site of other historic places:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGWl6TsYd9I/AAAAAAAAGC4/Y6QW5D1Wy1c/IMG_20100813_143305.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGWl6TsYd9I/AAAAAAAAGC4/Y6QW5D1Wy1c/IMG_20100813_143305.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We arrived in Amsterdam a short time later. We stayed at the America's Best Value hotel. The only one in town. Looks like new ownership is doing some serious renovations but the rooms were spacious, clean, and nice. BIL Mike and SO Maria live nearby and joined us for dinned. We ate at the on site indian restaurant -- naan and saag paneer -- mmmmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more day of riding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miles today: 49&lt;br /&gt;Miles total: 362.5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amsterdam to Albany:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last day of riding. We estimated about 50 miles. Best lunch possibility was Cohoe s, about 30 miles away. We were hoping to find a snack along the way but figured we'd make it on Nuun and Cliff Bars if needs be. The mileage looked to be formidable, but we also new the whole day would be on paved roads and paved trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving Amsterdam, we saw a couple more historic sites:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;

   <title>All roads may lead to Rome, but not all are paved</title>

   <content type="html">Today figured to be one of our longer days mileage wise, we didn't think it would be that tough or tricky to navigate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We checked out of our hotel at about 8:30 and hit the road. Streets through Syracuse, up a few hills towards the outskirts of town. Our directions and actual streets didn't quite jive so we had a little trouble finding our way back to the canal path, but once we did we figured it would be smooth sailing. Most of today was along the &quot;Old Erie Canal State Park.&quot; A 36 mile linear park stretching from Syracuse to Rome.&amp;nbsp; Just about all of it is off road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMyaf2_BuI/AAAAAAAAF_Q/1rBGV1AA_ao/s1600/IMG_20100811_092547.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMyaf2_BuI/AAAAAAAAF_Q/1rBGV1AA_ao/s200/IMG_20100811_092547.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMypRMsDsI/AAAAAAAAF_Y/s7Z3Yysg_ow/s1600/IMG_20100811_093605.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMypRMsDsI/AAAAAAAAF_Y/s7Z3Yysg_ow/s200/IMG_20100811_093605.jpg&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 17 miles in we got to Chitenango, birthplace of L. Frank Baum of &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; fame.&amp;nbsp; We spent some time at their &quot;Canal Boat Museum.&quot; It's on the site where they built and repaired canal boats. They've been working to restore as much of the site as possible. This includes the drydocks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMzUgsvXLI/AAAAAAAAF_0/yenDVdU5CRM/s1600/IMG_20100811_110232.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMzUgsvXLI/AAAAAAAAF_0/yenDVdU5CRM/s200/IMG_20100811_110232.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMzdXQrsdI/AAAAAAAAF_4/93Fxo4k5qEs/s1600/IMG_20100811_111038.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMzdXQrsdI/AAAAAAAAF_4/93Fxo4k5qEs/s200/IMG_20100811_111038.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as well as an 80% sized canal boat they're building:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMzp258PPI/AAAAAAAAGAE/W8ALxRligZE/s1600/IMG_20100811_111701.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMzp258PPI/AAAAAAAAGAE/W8ALxRligZE/s200/IMG_20100811_111701.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back on the trail, we spotted the remains of sunken canal boat (note the rebar tracing out the boat in the water):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMzzx7AVeI/AAAAAAAAGAI/U9pJ0kzMOrs/s1600/IMG_20100811_113100.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMzzx7AVeI/AAAAAAAAGAI/U9pJ0kzMOrs/s200/IMG_20100811_113100.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Continuing on, there were more locks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMz6iF9UFI/AAAAAAAAGAM/pZ952XKrbQU/s1600/IMG_20100811_144601.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGMz6iF9UFI/AAAAAAAAGAM/pZ952XKrbQU/s200/IMG_20100811_144601.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and bridges:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGM0D_oB1RI/AAAAAAAAGAU/FPR0gfn6h_I/s1600/IMG_20100811_144614.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGM0D_oB1RI/AAAAAAAAGAU/FPR0gfn6h_I/s200/IMG_20100811_144614.jpg&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch in Canastota, we set out on the second 25ish miles of the day. We found our way back onto the path, the stone dust was fine and even some of the road was paved. This lulled us into a sense of security. About 15 miles into the afternoon ride, we crossed path with what appeared to be a trail resurfacing machine. Not a good thing. The next few miles had us hugging the one good edge of the trail. The rest was soft and full of holes. The whole trail was also full of runs of dirt and gullies. All hazardous to us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We struggled through and made it to the outskirts of Rome. We followed the last few miles of path, but the path kept degrading. First to a rocky surface, then to one with pools of water, then to no path at all!!!! Fortunately, there was an outlet to a road nearby. We worked our way to it and followed the roads the rest of the way in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had made it to Rome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGM0D_oB1RI/AAAAAAAAGAU/FPR0gfn6h_I/s1600/IMG_20100811_144614.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGM0D_oB1RI/AAAAAAAAGAU/FPR0gfn6h_I/s200/IMG_20100811_144614.jpg&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch in Canastota, we set out on the second 25ish miles of  the day. We found our way back onto the path, the stone dust was fine  and even some of the road was paved. This lulled us into a sense of  security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After checking into the hotel and a cooling dip in the pool, we walked over to fort Stanwix, dating back to the French and Indian war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGM1SdeOSiI/AAAAAAAAGA0/c9V03bGaSZs/s1600/IMG_20100811_174126.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGM1SdeOSiI/AAAAAAAAGA0/c9V03bGaSZs/s320/IMG_20100811_174126.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGM1lKtcmnI/AAAAAAAAGA4/wiWcHcXk4c0/s1600/IMG_20100811_174156.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGM1lKtcmnI/AAAAAAAAGA4/wiWcHcXk4c0/s320/IMG_20100811_174156.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dinner at the Franklin Hotel (appropriately, Italian food. As they say, when in Rome...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow we head off to Little Falls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today: 49.5&lt;br /&gt;Total:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 269&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-324626734191713469?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Nothing to see here</title>

   <updated>2010-08-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://cestlaz.github.com/2010/08/10/nothing-to-see-here</id>
   <content type="html">Yesterday we left Seneca Falls and headed back north up to Syracuse. Our fifth day in a row of riding. Figured it could be one of the tougher days between the changing terrain and the return of the heat and humidity.&amp;nbsp; Apparently, there's no shade in northern NY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turned out to be true. The first part of the ride was mostly on road. Easy surface, but up and down.&amp;nbsp; When we got to the old canal path, it was more gravely than crushed stone. Felt like we were riding through mush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stopped about 20 mile in for lunch at Jordan. Just about our halfway point of the day and of the trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCC8cTQSwI/AAAAAAAAF9M/FdO1UkNllU8/s1600/IMG_20100809_123907.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCC8cTQSwI/AAAAAAAAF9M/FdO1UkNllU8/s320/IMG_20100809_123907.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other days when we were able to find nice local eateries, today we hat to resort to a single pizza place. Truth be told, it was pretty good but as the pizzeria was hot, we were actually better off eating at the picnic table in the sun out front. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back on the trail, there were some nice sights, including remnants from the old canal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDAI9Fa2I/AAAAAAAAF9U/3ogAk3MMLVc/s1600/IMG_20100809_123944.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDAI9Fa2I/AAAAAAAAF9U/3ogAk3MMLVc/s320/IMG_20100809_123944.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDBoilDCI/AAAAAAAAF9c/2l4t0kJibyM/s1600/IMG_20100809_124127.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDBoilDCI/AAAAAAAAF9c/2l4t0kJibyM/s320/IMG_20100809_124127.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDDBBAC6I/AAAAAAAAF9g/o-XNCakXEwg/s1600/IMG_20100809_133337.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDF94R9kI/AAAAAAAAF9o/1lEr5AnU7lo/s1600/IMG_20100809_135909.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDF94R9kI/AAAAAAAAF9o/1lEr5AnU7lo/s320/IMG_20100809_135909.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 42.5 tough miles, we ended up in Syracuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDJjSkSBI/AAAAAAAAF90/edt7IgpzS38/s1600/IMG_20100809_170609.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDJjSkSBI/AAAAAAAAF90/edt7IgpzS38/s320/IMG_20100809_170609.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hearty appetites in tow, we decided to sample Dinosaur Bar-B-Que. Good. Personally, I prefer the burnt ends at Rub and the overall meal at Hill Country, and those are just a couple of blocks from our house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDKYYof0I/AAAAAAAAF94/UOauSrVwiBE/s1600/IMG_20100809_170905.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGCDKYYof0I/AAAAAAAAF94/UOauSrVwiBE/s320/IMG_20100809_170905.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today was our rest day. Hot and humid -- would have been brutal to ride, but it wasn't a lot of fun walking around town. Not much to tell, just a quiet day. Most things we hoped to see were closed. We did get to the Erie Canal museum -- In the last remaining WeighLock house (sorry, no pictures, accidentally erased what was on my phone). To pay for the original canal as well as it's expansion, tolls were levied on good passing through. To determine the toll, canal boats had to be weighted. At the beginning of each season, weights were determined for each boat. Then, as they moved through the canal, they would enter a weighlock, the water would drain, depositing the boat on a huge wooden cradle which was part of a scale. The boat would be weighed and the toll assessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a picture from wikipedia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/ErieCanalMuseumSyracuse.JPG/250px-ErieCanalMuseumSyracuse.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/ErieCanalMuseumSyracuse.JPG/250px-ErieCanalMuseumSyracuse.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note the road in front -- that used to be the old canal. Other than the weigh lock building and a few other artifacts, there's nary a trace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the day was spent walking around and taking it easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;goog_725115&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;goog_725116&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGGRUAoj4bI/AAAAAAAAF-Y/ylZymwTXCrI/s1600/IMG_20100810_110327.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TGGRUAoj4bI/AAAAAAAAF-Y/ylZymwTXCrI/s320/IMG_20100810_110327.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miles from the previous day: 42.5&lt;br /&gt;Total: 219.5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow: All roads lead to Rome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-7077795059789910778?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

He seemed to do a good job&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;the last time we had a troubled person on that bridge. He even earned his wings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angel 2: I don't know, maybe they're just trying to decide on where to go to dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep there we were, on the bridge in Bedford, I mean Seneca Falls. The bridge and town that was purportedly used as a model for Frank Capra's &quot;It's a Wonderful Life.&quot; But how did we get there? Maybe we should start at the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We left our intrepid adventurers last night in Palmyra. After posting, we went to look at the Joseph Smith farm and Sacred Grove, passing the Mormon Temple and Church along the way. This morning after breakfast with what appeared to be a number of &quot;pilgrims&quot; getting ready to worship, we set off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requisite pretty pictures here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GbuC2jRI/AAAAAAAAF6s/DOE-e3hEtsU/s1600/IMG_20100808_084313.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GbuC2jRI/AAAAAAAAF6s/DOE-e3hEtsU/s320/IMG_20100808_084313.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9Gdo0lQjI/AAAAAAAAF60/_UQzuQEElRw/s1600/IMG_20100808_090932.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9Gdo0lQjI/AAAAAAAAF60/_UQzuQEElRw/s320/IMG_20100808_090932.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Passing through all the &quot;port&quot; towns, each with the canal neatly manicured. Straight banks and a narrow channel it's easy to forget that the whole project tied together a number of NY waterways. At points like in the above picture, it's much wider and the banks much more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We stopped at a hotel in Newark NY for the facilities. Natan noticed this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9Ge7sl-wI/AAAAAAAAF64/qDhPqccIY5o/s1600/IMG_20100808_093354.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9Ge7sl-wI/AAAAAAAAF64/qDhPqccIY5o/s320/IMG_20100808_093354.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The sign instructs to flush up for liquid waste, down for solid. We decided not to ask. Tim, I don't know if you read this blog, but I think you had a story about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there we moved from the canal path to the road. After a few miles on Bike Route 5, we ended up in Clyde. Ate at&amp;nbsp; &quot;Brickoven&quot; a restaurant that used to be an industrial bakery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GmIMCBmI/AAAAAAAAF7Q/yHwo-nhIkas/s1600/IMG_20100808_120721.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GmIMCBmI/AAAAAAAAF7Q/yHwo-nhIkas/s200/IMG_20100808_120721.jpg&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9Gm1qODcI/AAAAAAAAF7U/fHQDToHPSgM/s1600/IMG_20100808_121016.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9Gm1qODcI/AAAAAAAAF7U/fHQDToHPSgM/s200/IMG_20100808_121016.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Perfect stop for lunch. The corned beef hash I had wasn't great -- tasted like canned. Maybe that's just coming off of the hash I had at the diner in Tonowanda which was truly exceptional. Everything else was terrific and the staff and clientèle as friendly as could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there it was on route 414 until we got to Seneca Falls. We did some road riding on our first day, but this was our most extensive. We had some stretches of six foot shoulders, but some of three and some of none. Since the roads weren't that busy it wasn't too nerve wracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting though, to see how motorists treat you. Most motorists made attempts to slow down and shift at least partly into the neighboring lane (where oncoming traffic sometimes made this impossible). Every now and then, however, a car would blow by right next to us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly noticed a three car caravan that whooshed passed us. The first and third cars were no surprise -- a big honkin SUV and a red sports car. The car in the middle was an ice cream truck -- you know the kind. The small ones that park on a street corner to dispense Good Humor Bars. Complete with those big SLOW &lt;br /&gt;emblems on it. In all fairness to the SUV's most of them gave us wide berth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forty two miles after we started, we ended up in Seneca Falls. It's noted for a number of things including the women's rights movement. There are a number of plaques noting important achievements of women including Amelia Bloomer, Elizbeth Cady Stanton, and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We walked part of the town, passing the church where the first equal rights amendment was proposed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9Gp3rMNBI/AAAAAAAAF7g/rzvdjzcfzvY/s1600/IMG_20100808_160404.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9Gp3rMNBI/AAAAAAAAF7g/rzvdjzcfzvY/s200/IMG_20100808_160404.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cayuga - Seneca canal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GsM2bj7I/AAAAAAAAF7o/X011uG3IO4s/s1600/IMG_20100808_160908.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GsM2bj7I/AAAAAAAAF7o/X011uG3IO4s/s200/IMG_20100808_160908.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;And a neat sculpture garden:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GzUgyfgI/AAAAAAAAF8I/RNJ9VVTDJuI/s1600/IMG_20100808_164257.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF9GzUgyfgI/AAAAAAAAF8I/RNJ9VVTDJuI/s200/IMG_20100808_164257.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;After dinner, we walked back to our inn.

   <content type="html">Beautiful weather today, just like yesterday. Forgot to mention yesterday that Clarence Birdseye started his quick freezing experiments in Brockport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's start with the requisite canal pics:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3BcuqFYdI/AAAAAAAAF4Q/JldOAdU1-xA/s1600/IMG_20100807_094535.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3BcuqFYdI/AAAAAAAAF4Q/JldOAdU1-xA/s200/IMG_20100807_094535.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3Bo8TzlJI/AAAAAAAAF4g/a1etW0pVRNQ/s1600/IMG_20100807_095017.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3Bo8TzlJI/AAAAAAAAF4g/a1etW0pVRNQ/s200/IMG_20100807_095017.jpg&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a picture of my trusty steed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3BixkmluI/AAAAAAAAF4Y/DDgSo_19ryw/s1600/IMG_20100807_094917.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3BixkmluI/AAAAAAAAF4Y/DDgSo_19ryw/s320/IMG_20100807_094917.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We originally figured we'd get lunch at Rochester -- about 18 miles into the ride. If we felt good, we'd try to push on to Pittsford. We were pretty excited when we saw:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3Bq2SnbiI/AAAAAAAAF4k/W9G8ttVDbyY/s1600/IMG_20100807_110404.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3Bq2SnbiI/AAAAAAAAF4k/W9G8ttVDbyY/s320/IMG_20100807_110404.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the entire canal path in Rochester is in park so we rode right through without thinking about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At mile 25, we finally stopped for lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3Bwf-vA1I/AAAAAAAAF4w/Ew0Nbh5fpGM/s1600/IMG_20100807_135634.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3Bwf-vA1I/AAAAAAAAF4w/Ew0Nbh5fpGM/s200/IMG_20100807_135634.jpg&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3Bt-HHKpI/AAAAAAAAF4o/siPLwYGbn14/s1600/IMG_20100807_122959.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3Bt-HHKpI/AAAAAAAAF4o/siPLwYGbn14/s200/IMG_20100807_122959.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pittsford has a nice little park right on the canal. A Bike shop, a couple of other shops, and a few restaurants. We wanted to try the Crepe place, but long lines led us to a third day of medeteranian food. Not bad, and a pretty view of the canal. Besides, since we were eating outdoors, we didn't even have to lock up the bkes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were making much better time than our first two days, but today was a tough one for Batya. She just felt weak all day. On top of that, porta-potties were at a premium. Throughout the trip, we've been surprised by the cleanliness of the porta-potties on the canal route. We've been equally surprised by the irregularity of their spacing. Some times they're at every lift bridge, some time much further apart. Today, there was nothing from shortly after we set out up until lunch. In the afternoon, Batya was ecstatic to find:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3B1InLm1I/AAAAAAAAF44/qir0aRS0BUs/s1600/IMG_20100807_135818.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3B1InLm1I/AAAAAAAAF44/qir0aRS0BUs/s320/IMG_20100807_135818.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Other than the scenic ride, not too much today en route. We did see the lift bridge in Fairport. It's unique in that it has no right angles and that&amp;nbsp; the two banks are at different levels:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3B3fc-ddI/AAAAAAAAF48/6hICJZhzRmk/s1600/IMG_20100807_141325.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3B3fc-ddI/AAAAAAAAF48/6hICJZhzRmk/s200/IMG_20100807_141325.jpg&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3B71oEcmI/AAAAAAAAF5E/ryLc7yfOgPk/s1600/IMG_20100807_144322.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TF3B71oEcmI/AAAAAAAAF5E/ryLc7yfOgPk/s200/IMG_20100807_144322.jpg&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;We also saw: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm also continually amazed at the design and engineering of the canal.

   <content type="html">Day 3. From Lockport to Brockport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lockport is &quot;famous&quot; for it's locks -- the two channel 5 step ones. Brockport is famous for it's... brocks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a reasonable nights sleep and breakfast at Hambleton House, our BnB, we were off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx4tP1JEFI/AAAAAAAAF1c/h12KoxOqvrc/s1600/IMG_20100806_093418.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx4tP1JEFI/AAAAAAAAF1c/h12KoxOqvrc/s320/IMG_20100806_093418.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Here's one of the many lift bridges that cross the canal. Right now it's down. It's raised when a boat has to pass under. Back in the day, as there was much less road traffic, the bridges stayed in the raised position so boats and barges could pass. Stairways took pedestrians to the raised pathway to cross at any time. The bridge only had to be lowered when vehicular traffic had to cross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire day was spent right along the canal providing for some very pleasant scenery:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx4xygAZGI/AAAAAAAAF1k/XywYlgzeKsk/s1600/IMG_20100806_100916.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx4xygAZGI/AAAAAAAAF1k/XywYlgzeKsk/s200/IMG_20100806_100916.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx4z6cIbzI/AAAAAAAAF1s/zRr1S0R9nfU/s1600/IMG_20100806_100926.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx4z6cIbzI/AAAAAAAAF1s/zRr1S0R9nfU/s200/IMG_20100806_100926.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;And more lift bridges:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx5Vr6PplI/AAAAAAAAF2g/OzKoBz7N-9E/s1600/IMG_20100806_114638.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx5Vr6PplI/AAAAAAAAF2g/OzKoBz7N-9E/s200/IMG_20100806_114638.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crossing a canal aqueduct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx5nDHKxyI/AAAAAAAAF24/tq79--D6TM0/s1600/IMG_20100806_120451.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx5nDHKxyI/AAAAAAAAF24/tq79--D6TM0/s200/IMG_20100806_120451.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here, this aqueduct is the only point at which a road passes under the canal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then to the northern most point of the canal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx5s7inxZI/AAAAAAAAF3E/4AFrM93O61E/s1600/IMG_20100806_125455.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFx5s7inxZI/AAAAAAAAF3E/4AFrM93O61E/s320/IMG_20100806_125455.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 22 or so miles in, we stopped at Albion for lunch.

   <content type="html">Surpassing our day 1 total of 1 mile wasn't going to be hard. We set out for breakfast. Rode down by the Niagara River and over the Rainbow Bridge. I was a little surprised not to find Asgard on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFsqHeJqGgI/AAAAAAAAFys/HjjGnfMe1wo/s1600/IMG_20100805_092716.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFsqHeJqGgI/AAAAAAAAFys/HjjGnfMe1wo/s320/IMG_20100805_092716.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Back in New York, we continued on.

   <title>Erie Canal Day 1</title>

   <id>http://cestlaz.github.com/2010/08/05/erie-canal-day-1</id>
   <content type="html">Yesterday we started on a 12 day adventure. From Niagara Falls, Ont to Albany, mostly along the Erie Canal Tow path all by bike. A little more ambitious than our four day excursion outside of Pittsburgh last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bright and early we set out -- at Penn Station by 6:00am. That's where we had our first scare -- the Amtrak agent said we couldn't bring out bikes. Amtrak policy say's otherwise (folding bikes that fold to within a certain size are allowed at any time according to their on line regulations. We also checked by calling). The agent checked and we were allowed to board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFspGwBG7NI/AAAAAAAAFyA/Urp1eXL-WKw/s1600/IMG_20100804_150043.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFspGwBG7NI/AAAAAAAAFyA/Urp1eXL-WKw/s200/IMG_20100804_150043.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;After a long day on the train including about an hour waiting for customs, we got off at Niagara Falls, Ontario. After checking in to the hotel, we went down to the falls. Had dinner at an OK middle eastern place -- good Schwarma, so-so falafel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFspkOkxLJI/AAAAAAAAFyM/21VgEx7c__M/s1600/IMG_20100804_201218.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFspkOkxLJI/AAAAAAAAFyM/21VgEx7c__M/s200/IMG_20100804_201218.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFsp9yFEIAI/AAAAAAAAFyo/OuWbqkbv3iA/s1600/IMG_20100804_204634.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TFsp9yFEIAI/AAAAAAAAFyo/OuWbqkbv3iA/s200/IMG_20100804_204634.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We then walked back to the hotel for the night.&lt;br /&gt;Total milage: 1 (.5 from home to Penn Station and .5 from The Niagara Falls station to the hotel). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did walk 2 to 3 miles though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-5194588514322483498?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <content type="html">&amp;nbsp;Been a while since my last post but summer's coming so I think I'll have more time and energy. For today, a break from CS and Education issues and something on one of my other passions, bicycling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having not gone on a substantial ride for a while, yesterday, we decided to do a modified circumnavigation of NYC. Starting from home, we rode east over to first avenue. From there North...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;First stop, the UN. Here in front of the St. George and the Missile Dragon sculpture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_qY3_s-fM9jM/TB1WjtcpihI/AAAAAAAAKGQ/-8qI8qnmVSQ/s1600/P6190006.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_qY3_s-fM9jM/TB1WjtcpihI/AAAAAAAAKGQ/-8qI8qnmVSQ/s200/P6190006.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_qY3_s-fM9jM/TB1V1cBTR0I/AAAAAAAAKGI/fecb0uVeyTQ/s1600/P6190007.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_qY3_s-fM9jM/TB1V1cBTR0I/AAAAAAAAKGI/fecb0uVeyTQ/s200/P6190007.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Typically NY, the first guy we asked to take our picture said no.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;At 84th street, we made our way &lt;a href=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/TB0F6jQ81jI/AAAAAAAAFrQ/Gn2iXV-TzuQ/s640/IMG_20100619_122541.jpg&quot;&gt;Carl Shurz park&lt;/a&gt;.

   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made chapati the other day. Based on a couple of recipe requests and the fact that this blog has been dormant for a while, I thought I'd post the recipe here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;To start -- Chapati is an Indian flatbread. I guess what I made is technically Pulka but it's really easy to make and quite tasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/S94M2Dh9cgI/AAAAAAAAFoE/1Xh3w4TljhI/s1600/2010-05-02%2015.31.02.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/S94M2Dh9cgI/AAAAAAAAFoE/1Xh3w4TljhI/s320/2010-05-02%2015.31.02.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 cups whole wheat flour&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 cup water&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 tsp salt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mix all the ingredients together to form a dough. Don't add too much water (I did this time) or it will be hard to roll the dough.

   <content type="html">&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Sorting from the top and from the bottom&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've been meaning to write this post for a couple of weeks, but some times life just gets in the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've always thought it important to arm students with as many different tools with which to attack problems as possible. As such, the courses I teach use a number of different languages, each highlighting a different paradigm and thought process. The hope is that by the end of the sequence, they can look at problems from many different angles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my advanced placement classes, we recently studied sorting algorithms.  It think the quicksort is a good example of a problem that can be looked at from multiple points of view. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my experiences talking to teachers and students who cut there teeth using languages like Java, C, or C++, much of the discussion deals with the actual partitioning of the array. Comparing elements, swapping them and arriving in the middle. One might end up with something like this as a first cut: &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;pre class=&quot;src src-java&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt; 1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #228b22;&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;qsort&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&quot;color: #228b22;&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;[] &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a0522d;&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&quot;color: #228b22;&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a0522d;&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #228b22;&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a0522d;&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt; 2:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt; 3:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (l&amp;gt;=h)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt; 4:  &lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt; 5:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt; 6:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #b22222;&quot;&gt;/* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #b22222;&quot;&gt;Just use lowest index as pivot for now */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt; 7:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #228b22;&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a0522d;&quot;&gt;pivot&lt;/span&gt; = a[l];&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt; 8:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #228b22;&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a0522d;&quot;&gt;low&lt;/span&gt;=l;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt; 9:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #228b22;&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a0522d;&quot;&gt;high&lt;/span&gt;=h;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;10:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;11:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #b22222;&quot;&gt;/* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #b22222;&quot;&gt;partition the data set around the pivot value */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;12:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; (l&amp;lt;=h)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;13:  &lt;/span&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;14:  &lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; (a[l]&amp;lt;pivot)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;15:  &lt;/span&gt;    l++;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;16:  &lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; (a[h]&amp;gt;pivot)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;17:  &lt;/span&gt;    h--;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;18:  &lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (l&amp;lt;=h)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;19:  &lt;/span&gt;  {&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;20:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span style=&quot;color: #228b22;&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a0522d;&quot;&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;=a[l];&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;21:  &lt;/span&gt;    a[l]=a[h];&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;22:  &lt;/span&gt;    a[h]=tmp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;23:  &lt;/span&gt;    l++;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;24:  &lt;/span&gt;    h--; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;25:  &lt;/span&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;26:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;27:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;28:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #b22222;&quot;&gt;/* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #b22222;&quot;&gt;sort items below and above the pivot */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;29:  &lt;/span&gt;qsort(a,low,l-1);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;30:  &lt;/span&gt;qsort(a,l,high);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;31:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;32:  &lt;/span&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;    &lt;p&gt;A fair amount of time and detail is spent dealing with the low level movement of data within the array . This is important &amp;ndash; good stuff, but it takes the emphasis away from the higher level elegance of the algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quicksort can be described as: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; If the size of the list is &lt;= 1, return.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; Select a pivot element&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Generate the list L of items smaller than the pivot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Generate the list H of items larger than the pivot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; the sorted list is qsort(L)+pivot+qsort(R)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having seen some scheme in their intro class, our students have a tool with which we can describe the quicksort in terms much closer to the description (allowing for the fact that this doesn't deal with multiple values equal to the pivot correctly): &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;pre class=&quot;src src-scheme&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt; 1:  &lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;define&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;makefilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt; 2:  &lt;/span&gt;  (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; (op x)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt; 3:  &lt;/span&gt;    (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; (n) (op x n))))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt; 4:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt; 5:  &lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;define&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;qsort&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt; 6:  &lt;/span&gt;  (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; (l)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt; 7:  &lt;/span&gt;    (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;cond&lt;/span&gt; ((null? l) '())&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt; 8:  &lt;/span&gt;          (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; (append (qsort (filter (makefilter &amp;gt; (car l)) l))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt; 9:  &lt;/span&gt;                        (list (car l))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;10:  &lt;/span&gt;                        (qsort (filter (makefilter &amp;lt; (car l)) l)))))))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;    &lt;p&gt;This allows us to discuss the quicksort at a much higher level and focus on things like selecting a good pivot or the analysis of the run time. I believe this makes it much easier to really understand what's going on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having discussed it in this functional context, we can also look at the same thing in a scripting language such as python: &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;pre class=&quot;src src-python&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0000ff;&quot;&gt;qsort&lt;/span&gt;(l):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;2:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;(l)&amp;lt;=1:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;3:  &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; l&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;4:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;else:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;5:  &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; qsort([x &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; l[1:] &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; x &amp;lt;= l[0]]) + [l[0]]+\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;6:  &lt;/span&gt;            qsort([x &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; l[1:] &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; x &amp;gt; l[0]])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;linenr&quot;&gt;7:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Again, the focus is on the algorithm, not the array or list manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the problem from both the more abstract side, which in this case functional languages allow, and the more concrete, as we did in Java gives our students more tools with which to attack problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just some food for thought. &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-2070280110494147035?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>What's Next</title>
   <link href="http://cestlaz.github.com/2010/02/18/whats-next.html"/>
   <updated>2010-02-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://cestlaz.github.com/2010/02/18/whats-next</id>
   <content type="html">Just a short follow up on the last post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In thinking about how I frequently programs, once I have a plan, I work on one part of the project, and then ask myself &quot;what's next?&quot; That is, what is the next step towards completion.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It reminded me about a guest speaker we had a about a year and a half ago at one of our &quot;professional development&quot; days. For the past two years, our school has had &quot;writing across the curriculum&quot; as one of it's goals. While it's a laudable idea, I find the rationale for this goal to be poorly communicated to our faculty and the implementation weak at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, the guest speaker, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Zinsser&quot;&gt;William Zinsser&lt;/a&gt;, made a few good points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The most important reason for most of us to write is to convey ideas or arguments. In short, communication. Many students have problems organizing and ordering their thoughts and as a result, their writing is all over the place. Zinsser simplified it to the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does the audience know?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do they need to know next?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;That drives your next sentence. You continue this 1-2 punch until you've communicated your ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes loads of sense, but here I was 40 years old and it was the first time I heard writing explained this way. What really struck me, however was that this concept wasn't new at all. Every ninth or tenth grader goes through this process time and time again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about geometric proof. We have some given information and a conclusion we wish to prove. At each step along the way its:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do we know so far?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's the next step to get us closer to the conclusion?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same can be said for program development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course this makes tremendous sense since all thee things: writing, proof, and programming, are methods of communication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just something to think about.&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-1983623605693836355?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>They teach programming, don't they?</title>
   <link href="http://cestlaz.github.com/2010/02/15/they-teach-programming-dont-they.html"/>
   <updated>2010-02-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://cestlaz.github.com/2010/02/15/they-teach-programming-dont-they</id>
   <content type="html">One evening, many years ago, when I was in college, I had an epiphany. Maybe not as enlightening as the epiphany I had while watching &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;&amp;nbsp; many years later, but that's a story for another day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While working on some class project, I realized that soon, within a couple of&amp;nbsp; years, I'd be working for a real company and I'd actually have to write code that &lt;b&gt;REALLY&lt;/b&gt; works. Not just something that gets past the grader, or answers all the test cases. Something well designed, well written, maintainable, and reliable.&amp;nbsp; Scary thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've thought about this a lot since I started teaching computer science. We teach programming languages, algorithms, and assign projects. Maybe the students hear something like &quot;comment your code,&quot; or &quot;use good variable names,&quot; but we never really give them the tools to take a project from description to completion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too often young programmers rush to the keyboards and write copious amounts of code without any plan and with little discipline. In short they do everything they can to set themselves up for a difficult road ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;There are probably a number of reasons for this. When we teach introductory&amp;nbsp; programming, assignments are so short and simple that we can't easily model good programming techniques, and if we do, it's difficult to get students to &quot;buy in&quot; since it's hard for them to see the value. As complexity increases, we're faced with limited time to actually cover the prescribed course content, leaving little room for a protracted unit on &quot;program development.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm certainly not going to be so bold as to say that I have the answer to the problem, but I've tried some things to help address it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll take a few class days to take a project from beginning to end. Something that can be done incrementally but isn't particularly difficult. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This semester, I attempted this with my AP students. We wrote a series of text filters in Java. I lifted the topic from Kernighan and Plauger's &quot;Software Tools.&quot; We wrote versions of character count, word count, detabbing a file, run length encoding and a simple version of tr. Nothing too heavy, but it allowed us to focus on the development piece rather than coming up with clever algorithms and data structures (which is what the rest of the class is for). The problem may be a little contrived, but I hope the benefits outweighed any issues with the choice of problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We start by talking about the importance of understanding the problem, which includes finding out what &quot;the client&quot; wants and not making our own assumptions. Some times, I try to leave a little ambiguity to give us a platform to discuss the &quot;what the client wants&quot; issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there comes design, which might be mixed with writing some code to make sure we understand certain aspects of the problem and the environment we'll be working in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once we have a design and a plan we can start incremental development. This is what I think is most important for the youngsters. I try to model and emphasize the idea of coding one &quot;concept&quot; at a time. Frequently testing that concept and only moving on once it's completed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll also talk about things that have worked for me along the way. I always like to put consistent comment blocks at the top of my functions, trying to keep functions a &quot;screen length&quot; or shorter, my preferences for naming, indentation, etc. Of course, I'm careful to emphasize that my way works for me, but it's just one approach. I try to present alternatives when possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other ideas I try to emphasize is actually reading ones code and having others read it. Last semester I experimented with &quot;pair programming&quot; and while I have no idea how good it is as a professional development technique, I like it from a pedagogical point of view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think presenting these ideas while actually developing the project helps to drive in the concepts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd like to think adding units like this helps to develop stronger programmers. Any teachers out there -- your thoughts?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;width: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ljE9q55t6ltZzZVKwTzA9g?authkey=Gv1sRgCOSJ5YGwwb7e_AE&amp;amp;feat=embedwebsite&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh3.ggpht.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/S3m2eJx5aiI/AAAAAAAAFj4/I57gKwaFxzQ/s144/2010-02-15%2008.49.59.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an unrelated note, yesterday was valentines day. We don't really do anything to celebrate it, but in anticipation of her new loom, Devorah had to clear off some room in the apartment. She stumbled upon love letters sent between my parents back in the fifties. If you'd like a small taste of the past, you can see here post on squidknits &lt;a href=&quot;http://squid-knits.blogspot.com/2010/02/love-letters.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although we have gained all this immediacy with the electronics age, it sometimes feels that somethings been lost.&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-3365288827630860097?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Subversion for Homework part II and the start of the new term</title>
   <link href="http://cestlaz.github.com/2010/02/01/subversion-for-homework-part-ii-and.html"/>
   <updated>2010-02-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://cestlaz.github.com/2010/02/01/subversion-for-homework-part-ii-and</id>
   <content type="html">Starting the new semester tomorrow and I've got a whole bunch of interesting topics to blog about. Some about pedagogy, some technical, and some that I can't really catagorize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, though, just a brief follow up on using Subversion for homework collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic model used in New York City for teacher improvement and evaluation is the official &quot;observation.&quot; Either your supervisor or the principal sits in on one of your classes. Afterwards you meet and discuss the lesson and a report is written up. Basically, there are two possible outcomes: satisfactory or unsatisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Untenured teachers are generally observed three times a semester. Tenured teachers, once a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all cases, this system is severely flawed. The supervisor sees a 40 minute snapshot out of context and is supposed to evaluate the teacher and make recommendations for teacher improvement. It's generally of limited value at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this, years ago, I started to ask my students to evaluate me. For quite some time now, I've used a custom written web app that allows students to complete long questionnaires over a period of weeks. The system allows me to know who submitted an evaluation while maintaining anonymity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've found these evaluations to be incredibly valuable and I've used them to try to improve my classes and my teaching over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having just wrapped the semester, I've gone through my students responses and the vast majority liked using subversion for homework. As I figured, some felt that it was a little confusing at first and there was a learning curve but most felt it was either as good as any other method and many said it was superior.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This combined with the fact that it makes me more efficient confirms that it's a win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was also interesting that I had hardly any suggestions for alternative ways of collecting homework.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I've been using Git for my personal development work and I'm planning on experimenting with it in one of my classes, so we'll see how that goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on to the new semester!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-3477377644002525047?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <content type="html">Ok, not &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/subversion&quot;&gt;subversion&lt;/a&gt;, rather &lt;a href=&quot;http://subversion.tigris.org/&quot;&gt;subversion&lt;/a&gt;, the version control system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've used subversion as a way for students to hand in their projects for years. I haven't used it with my intro classes as I think the learning curve is a little steep and the benefits few, but for A.P. and beyond (juniors and seniors) it's worked very well as a method of collection and I think it's good to get the kids in the habit of using versioning systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A versioning, or revision control system let's an individual frequently save versions of their files, in our case, on a central server.&amp;nbsp; One can easily go back to earlier versions as well as manage changes made by multiple developers. Once one's in the habit of using a revision control system, it can greatly improve&amp;nbsp; productivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my classes, I would create a repository for a project, give the kids a little version control primer, and they would create projects in the repository.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are usually a few bumps in the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first the kids go kicking and screaming. They create the repository, and neglect it until the last minutes. I'd wake up on a project due date, check out the repository and seem maybe 4 out of 60 projects only to see them mystically appear as the closing time approached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we move through the year and work on more projects, things get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Students start to update their projects more frequently. Not as frequently as I like, partly because SVN gets really slow on our system, but it's still an improvement.&amp;nbsp; Invariably, it saves a student or two when they accidentally delete all their files. Also, when things become&amp;nbsp; a real mess, being able to go back a few versions is a godsend. A much better alternative than what they had to do in the past, which was restarting the entire project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I find really interesting is how wonderful a tool svn is from my point of view as an educator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By looking at the log files, I can see who made changes and when. By looking at the diffs, I can look at the projects progress much as an english teacher might look at drafts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Version control for projects turns out to be a win across the board.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Recently, I've been using SVN for homeworks as well. Homework collection has always been difficult for me as I'm disorganized and forgetful. SVN has made things much easier. At the start of the semester, I made a homework repository for each student. They then check it out at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever a student does a homework, he or she just names it according to our conventions (HW1-name, HW2-name, etc.), put it in their checked out repository, add the file(s) and commits. With tortoiseSVN under windows it's trivial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lets me easily see all of the homeworks for a student as well as all submissions for a specific assignment. Again it's an overall win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next semester I'm going to be experimenting with GIT as a replacement for SVN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're looking for a way to collect and track assignments, I'd highly recommend using a revision control system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-8125210248407710385?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Love the bike. Love riding. It's the fastest, most pleasant way to get around the city. My commute by bike, door to door is 12 minutes. Subway is 20 - 25. Walking about 45. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One certainly can't let winter weather get in the way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/S1BdvWzkMpI/AAAAAAAAFio/hk5KchXYRaI/s1600-h/fugu.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/S1BdvWzkMpI/AAAAAAAAFio/hk5KchXYRaI/s320/fugu.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I've got the body covered with my Assos Fugu jacket. With just a cheap long sleeve duofold shirt it's great to about 16 degrees. It feels a little boxy off the bike, but as soon as you're riding, it fits like a glove. Expensive, but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My real problem has always been my hands. Especially on a short commute when I don't have time to generate body heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/S1BaYW72AlI/AAAAAAAAFiQ/-IKb6X9aZ1M/s1600-h/P1010711.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/S1BaYW72AlI/AAAAAAAAFiQ/-IKb6X9aZ1M/s200/P1010711.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most recently, I've been using Pearl Izumi Inferno Gloves. They're ok, but sub 20 degress, they don't do it, particularly since I like riding the hoods where I'm right up against cold metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year, my wife made a wonderful discovery....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/S1BaDtFi4yI/AAAAAAAAFh4/kwmiZhDcUiw/s1600-h/P1010708.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/S1BaDtFi4yI/AAAAAAAAFh4/kwmiZhDcUiw/s200/P1010708.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trails-edge.com/retail/te_shirts/amfbikemits.htm&quot;&gt;Moose Mitts&lt;/a&gt;!!!!

   <title>Towers of Hanoi</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/S0pFwojEDmI/AAAAAAAAFa8/WMWXtwK6nxo/s1600-h/Hanoi.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7YN3bkG0cSc/S0pFwojEDmI/AAAAAAAAFa8/WMWXtwK6nxo/s320/Hanoi.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Closed out last week teaching the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cut-the-knot.org/recurrence/hanoi.shtml&quot;&gt;Towers of Hanoi&lt;/a&gt;. It's a wonderful topic. Not because it's so interesting in and of itself, but as a platform from which you can explore any number of interesting topics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many books appropriate for the AP (AB) curriculum mention the towers, but to my knowledge most only scratch the surface. I randomly grabbed two books that I consider good from the shelf before writing this. One that I actually use when I teach AP comp sci and another more appropriate for a follow up course. Both discuss the towers, but merely show a solution and talk about the run time a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many possibilities left out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually do these lessons with my sophomores but since many of my AP students (juniors) hadn't ever seened the problem, I felt it was worth covering. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By looking at a few small examples, 1 disk, two disks, three disks, four disks, it's easy to notice the symetry in the solutions ultimately leading the this short routine: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-java&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-java&quot;&gt; 1:  hanoi(n,src,dst,tmp) {&lt;br /&gt; 2:    &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (n==1)&lt;br /&gt; 3:      System.out.println(&lt;span style=&quot;color: #8b2252;&quot;&gt;&quot;Move from &quot;&lt;/span&gt;+src+&lt;span style=&quot;color: #8b2252;&quot;&gt;&quot; to &quot;&lt;/span&gt;+dst);&lt;br /&gt; 4:    &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a020f0;&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 5:    {&lt;br /&gt; 6:      hanoi(n-1,src,tmp.dst);&lt;br /&gt; 7:      hanoi(1,src,dst,tmp);&lt;br /&gt; 8:      hanoi(n-1,tmp,dst,src);&lt;br /&gt; 9:    }&lt;br /&gt;10:  }  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the fun can really start: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We want to talk about the correctness of our algorithm and also how many moves it will take, that is, the run time. First, we'll use inductive ideas to show our algorithm is correct. This &quot;proof&quot; (we do it somewhat informally) can be enlightening. As sophomores, the only proofs students have seen are those statement/reason things they do in math class. Here we can introduce them to the idea that proof is just an &quot;irrefutable argument&quot; and apply it in a more practical setting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there we look at run time, that is, how many moves will it take to solve the n disk problem. It's easy to see the pattern of T(N) = 2T(n-1)+1 . Students will usually see that we can rewrite this as T(N)=2&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;-1 which we can also prove by induction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we can see the ramifications of the run time. At 1 million moves per second, it works out to close to 600,000 years. This in and of itself is revealing, we can't just &quot;get a faster computer.&quot;  Here we can discuss &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law&quot;&gt;Moore's Law&lt;/a&gt; and the physical limits on our computers, making sure to make appropriate reference to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper&quot;&gt;Grace Hopper&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/shinythings/154816771/&quot;&gt;nanosecond&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leads to a discussion alternate approaches such as parallel processing, but that doesn't work if our problem can only be solved sequentially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the class is used discussing other hard problems and other approaches including heuristics, probabalistic, randomized, and anything else that comes up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there you have it. From this one simple problem we get to introduce students to: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Alternate forms of proof (specificall induction) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Intractable problems &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Unsolvable problem &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;sec-4&quot;&gt;Moores law and the limits of our computing power &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;sec-5&quot;&gt;Alternate approaches to computing &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;sec-5&quot;&gt;Parallel programming &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;sec-5.2&quot;&gt;Protein based computers &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;sec-5.3&quot;&gt;Randomized algorithms &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;sec-5.4&quot;&gt;Probabalistic algorithms &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;sec-5.5&quot;&gt;Heuristics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-6512019415176840666?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Talking Shop</title>
   <link href="http://cestlaz.github.com/2010/01/06/talking-shop.html"/>
   <updated>2010-01-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://cestlaz.github.com/2010/01/06/talking-shop</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;During my first few years teaching computer science, I frequently felt isolated. As pretty much the only CS guy I really didn't have any one to &quot;talk shop&quot; with. It's hard to bounce pedagogical ideas off of your colleagues when they teach subjects that are tangentially related, at best. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I now consider myself extremely fortunate that I have four terrific friends and colleagues teaching CS with me. Now we have the same advantage that other teachers have enjoyed for years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I started one of my favorite topics in my AP classes, recursion. Our students have already done recursion during the scheme unit of our intro class so today was at some levels, a review. Most of the students were fine with the basic concepts, but I wanted to make sure they had a solid foundation before we moved to more advanced problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I realized even though I &quot;got&quot; recursion back when I was starting out as a CS student those many years ago, no one ever really explained how the call stack worked. When you're calling functions and methods all over the place, how does the system know to return to the right place at the right time. It was alluded to when we expanded a recursion: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;fact(4) &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; 4*fact(3) &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; 3*fact(2) &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; 2*fact(1) &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; 1*fact(0) &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; 1 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;but never in the general sense of function calls. I thought it might make sense to try to &quot;demystify&quot; the computer and explain how things really worked.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I outlined a basic memory layout, stack, heap, data segment and roughly defined a stack frame (storing parameters, local variables, and a return address). We then looked at a code snippet such as: &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;pre class=&quot;src src-Java&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a()&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;  b();&lt;br /&gt;  c();&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b()&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;  c();&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c()&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;main()&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;  a();&lt;br /&gt;  b();&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;    &lt;p&gt;and traced through the stack. We then did this with a couple of simple recursive examples. Only time will tell if this was helpful, but I think it was worth the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I particularly enjoyed was later that day when I was talking shop with my fellow AP teacher. He wasn't planning on explaining the stack in this kind of detail but he liked the idea and planned to use that part of my lesson. I look forward to hearing how it went. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have likewise borrowed ideas from his and our other colleagues classes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any CS teachers out there, I'm sure we'd all love to hear classroom techniques that have and haven't worked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-4999548631085910659?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>First Day Back</title>
   <link href="http://cestlaz.github.com/2010/01/04/first-day-back.html"/>

   <id>http://cestlaz.github.com/2010/01/04/first-day-back</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;First day back after a break is always hard. By the last day of vacation, I'm actually sleeping a little later and shifting the body clock back is rather harsh. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's tough enough getting started again, but it's even worse when you're thrown a curve ball. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got in at my usual 7:00, made my coffee, and started getting my lessons ready for the day. At about 7:30 we lost power in half of the room. Unfortunately, it was the half with the CS servers. The machines that provide log in and file services as well as svn, our web server, mail server, wiki and other services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, on top of my teaching duties (four classes of 32 students and another of about 20), I basically run the computer services for our CS program. I used to do the whole network, but I stopped that a few years ago. I receive some help from colleagues, but it's still mostly me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our CS program we have two Linux labs of about 31 computers each (all running Linux) and a bunch of servers running the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After spending about 20 minutes to find the circuit breaker, most services came back up. Terror struck 10 minutes later when we saw that all of the students home directories had disappeared!!!!! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a brief period of panic and a few stressful minutes of scouring file systems for evidence of the missing directories I found the problem. The answer, as with so many other problems, is that I was being an idiot. About a month earlier, I had installed a new drive for the student directories. I had mounted it, but neglected to change the fstab file. This is what happens when you have to do all your sysadmin work on live systems in brief periods of time between classes. When we lost power today, the old drive was mounted, not the new one. It's fixed now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be nice if there we actually had people to run our systems, but since that's not going to happen, I've spend time over the years to try to make the whole thing somewhat do able. Using common tools such as NFS, NIS, Apache and the like help, and we've currently moved to using kvm for virtual machines so we can easily experiment with new systems and cleanly and have a one &quot;machine&quot; per service mentality, but system administration still can't really be done as a part time job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any one out there have any war stories or suggestions as part time sysadmins? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-4782617949077508854?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <content type="html">For the winter break, I assigned &lt;a href=&quot;http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap08_comp_sci_a_frq.pdf&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; set of A exam questions (actually, just the three that don't deal with the case study) to my AP classes. I wanted to assign something that wasn't particularly heavy but I didn't want my students to forget everything over break. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with most AP exam questions, they're long, wordy, and somewhat brain dead. They take a long time to read, but they frequently take you step by step through what they want you to do. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I remember the first time I really thought about this. It was back when the exam was given in Pascal. The curriculum required that classes cover one of the nlogn sorts but didn't specify which one. One of the free response questions literally walked the students, step by step, through the merge sort. Part one had them split an array in to two parts, part two had them write a routine that merged two sorted arrays (and explained step by step how to do it). You could get a perfect score and still know nothing about the algorithm, or even about writing a recursive routine (since the question told you exactly what to do). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hate these types of questions. The exam tests coders, not computer scientists. Programming competition problems (such as from the  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uwp.edu/sws/usaco/&quot;&gt;USACO&lt;/a&gt;) are much more interesting, but from a beginners point of view they have their own problems. Beginners might not have enough tools to attack them, and at times they're all or nothing – they're not set up to develop a simple, working solution that you can then improve on. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, I'm always looking for interesting questions for my students. Problems that a student can attack with a minimal skill set, but can be refined through analysis or upon studying more advanced techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I guess the first problem of this nature that I usually do with my AP students, usually deals with counting frequencies of test student test scores, identifying students by their four digit ID number. Most students start by creating a huge list all the tests for all the students, but some, and soon all, realize that by using the ID number as an index into an array, they can solve this type of problem much more efficiently. Looking at this technique early also sets the stage for looking at topics such as radix sorting and hashing later on. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This weekend I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://20bits.com/articles/interview-questions-two-bowling-balls/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; problem and we'll probably look at in in class some time this week. I like it because you can easily get a naive solution, but it lends it self to a step wise refinement that works well in the classroom.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few years ago, I also discovered a wonderful article by David Ginat, titled &quot;Effective binary perspectives in algorithmic problem solving&quot; which you can get if you are an ACM member &lt;a href=&quot;http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=772942&amp;amp;dl=&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both the stuff in Ginat's piece and the bowling ball article are nice because they can be handled naively with brute force approaches using arrays, but with a little cleverness you can do much better. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, as students progress through our classes, we have more flexibility as to types of questions. For example, once we do search and other recursive algorithms a few weeks from now, I can present problems that lead to dynamic programming solutions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'd love to hear any interesting accessible problems you've come across in your computing careers.&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-7947206663945758208?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   <content type="html">Over the past twenty years or so, I've mulled, discussed, and argued various aspects of education, computer science, and of course computer science education with friends, students, and colleagues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past summer, I had the privilege to get to meet and briefly work with comp sci educators from around the country and started to thing that there were other like minded people, but we didn't have a forum with which to communicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also started to think that maybe some of the things I've discovered over the past twenty years might be useful to some one&amp;nbsp; if only it were available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there you go. The plan is to regularly post about items of interest that I've come up&amp;nbsp; with ranging from pedagogical techniques,&amp;nbsp; to facilities management, to interesting class topics, to anything else that seems relevant. I'd imagine that some of my other interests, notably food, biking, and family will also creep in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope others find this interesting and relevant.&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/468689896075458340-2438686823306490556?l=cestlaz.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
